Chapter I - Introduction - [01.Intr]

*******************************************************************************


This is my first ever FAQ/Guide.  I was surprised to note that Starcraft II had
been out for two weeks and didn't yet have a campaign guide so I decided to 
write one.  I'll deffinately fine tune it and tweak it over time, but now it is
a complete working guide.  Everything you need to know to finish every 
objective in the game is here, including the 4 side quests for Zeratul and the
secret mission to discover the origins of the Hybrid.  I hope you find
everything you're looking for here.  Enjoy the game and good luck!


*******************************************************************************

Chapter II - Walkthrough - Wings of Liberty (Terran Campaign) - [02.Walk]

*******************************************************************************

This walkthrough is intended to help you make your way from the very beginning 
of the Terran Campaing, Wings of Liberty, to their final confrontation.  In it
you will find everything you need to know to successfully complete each 
mission.  At the beginning of each mission there will be an overview.  It will
show you all of the primary and secondary objectives for that mission.  It will
list any credit bonus for completing the mission and any research bonus for
completing the secondary objectives.  At this time no Story elements that exist
outside the mission will be overviewed.  It will list suggested research 
options after missions when you reach the seperate Tiers of research.

There are two stories taking place in Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty.  
Basically there is a Terran vs Zerg campaign and Terran vs Mengks campaign.
There are elements of all three races mixed in, but the two campaigns have 
definite individual storylines.  As such the missions will be listed in the 
order that they first become available.  

Notably this walkthrough is only one way to complete the game.  While many may 
have alternate strategies, each mission listed below will still give you all 
the information you need to complete it even if you choose to use an 
alternative strategy.  With that being said, let's begin!


****************************************
Prologue - Mission 0.1 - Liberation Day
****************************************


Primary Mission Objective: Destroy the Dominion Outpost
Unit Unlocked: Marine

In Mission Objectives
.....Destroy the Logistics Headquarters
.....Raynor Must Survive

Bonus Objectives
.....Destroy Dominion Holoboards [6]

Jim Raynor is airdropped in the southwest of the map with five marines.  Follow
the road to the east.  A short way up the road you will run into two dominion
marines.  They are easily killed by your troops.  Follow the road as it bends
north.  A very short way along the road and you'll be given your first bonus
objective to destroy 6 holoboards throughout Backwater.  The first is 
immediately to the right of the road and is impossible to miss.  Continue to 
follow the road roughly north.  You will encounter a single dominion marine.
Kill it and move on.  The road takes a slight southwest turn and then ends in a
paved area.  First auto-save will occur here, prepare for your first decent 
fight.

Eight Dominion marines are in the paved area, and near their center is the 
second holoboard.  Be sure to destroy it as well as the marines.  Before you
move in nine more marines will be airdropped to join your forces.  The third
holoboard is slightly southeast of the second holoboard and should be visible
when you enter the plaza.  Continue to the southwest side of the plaza to find
the fourth holoboard.  Then follow the new road out of the plaza to the north.

A small cutscene appears here.  Afterwards engage the four dominion marines and
their transport.  Remember to destroy the very obvious fifth holoboard here.
Follow the road Northeast.  On the east side of the road will be the sixth and 
final holoboard.  Destroy it to ensure your bonus.  At this point the civilians
will charge northeast into the Outpost to help you destroy what resistance 
there is.  A whopping five marines and two vikings try to hold you back.
Destroy the outpost building and finish the mission.
 


****************************************
Prologue - Mission 0.2 - The Outlaws
****************************************


Primary Mission Objective: Seize the Xel'Naga Artifact
Credit Reward: 45,000
Unit Unlocked: Medic

In Mission Objectives
.....Destroy the Dominion Base

Bonus Objectives
.....Rescue the Rebels

This mission begins you with a Command Center, Barracks, and a single Supply
Depot.  You also start with 8 SCVs and 6 Marines, leaving you at 14/19 
supplies.  There are 10 mineral deposits and a single Vespene Gas Geyser.  
Start off by sending all of your SCVs to gathering minerals.  Keep building
SCVs with all your minerals until you have 14.  While they are building make 
sure 10 end up mining, the 11th should build a refinery and start gathering 
gas.  Then next two should also gather gas.  Your 14th and final SCV will be 
for building supply depots.  While all this SCV work is going on send your 
marines scouting to the north.  Keep them close while the SCVs work.  There is
a vespene gas and mineral pallet to the north just over the first road.  Grab
these for a boost to your resources.  By now you should have enough resources
to build the Tech Lab onto your Barracks.  Do so then immediately build 
2 medics.  You should also have enough resources to build 2-3 supply depots.
Do so.  SPend this time building up a force of 4 medics and 12 marines total.
Back to your scouting marines.  Further north past the road you will find 3 
more mineral pallets to boost your resources.  

Once you have at least half your force (6 marines and 2 medics) send them all
further down the road.  Once it begins to vere northwest head off road to the 
southwest.  There is a rebel base under attack by 8 dominion marines.  Your
marines should make short work of them with your 2 medics supporting them.  
This is the Bonus Objective for the stage.  Rescue the Rebels.  One the 
platform that has the beacon there is a mineral pallet and a gas pallet.  Grab
them as usual.  With your full force and these added rebel troops you should be
ready to finish the mission.

Continue offroad northwest past the rebel base and you will shortly arrive at 
the dominion base.  Your force of 18 marines and 7 medics should be unstopable
in clearing out the base.  Two hellions will attempt to intercept you on your 
way to the base as you come in sight of the archeological dig site.  On the 
west site of the dig is a bunker.  Take it out along with the 4 marines inside.
Inside the base you will encounter 4-5 more marines and another hellion.  After
dealing with them go straight for the barracks.  It might have a few more 
marines guarding it.  After taking out the barrkacs head to the east side of 
the base and take out the factory.  Another stragling marine and hellion will
engage you.  After you finish off the Factory clean up the SCVs, supply depots,
and the command center and you've finished the second prologue mission.



****************************************
Prologue - Mission 0.3 - Zero Hour
****************************************


Primary Mission Objective: Hold out until Extraction
Credit Reward: 55,000
Structure Unlocked: Bunker

In Mission Objectives
.....Hold out for Evacuation [20:00]

Bonus Objectives
.....Rescue the Rebels [3]


You begin this mission with a command center, 2 barracks, an engineering bay, 
3 supply depots, 4 bunkers and 4 missile turrets.  You also start with 5 SCVs
and 16 marines.  Immediately fill the 2 bunkers furthest from the base.  Have
your 5 scv's begin mining minerals, que up 5 more SCVs to be made at the 
Command center, and the first SCV that is built should be sent to the front 
lines.  Have him build a matching bunker for each of the two bunkers on your
perimeter.  You will basically ignore the 2 inner bunkers for the duration of
this mission.  There are 9 mineral deposits and 1 Vespene Geyser.  That means
13 total SCV's.  This time we'll have 1 more though that will stay near the 
forward bunkers to repair them.  Have a barracks make a tech lab and build 2
medics.

Near the 17.5 minute marker you will be given an option to move out and save a
group of pinned down rebels.  Send your 8 non-bunkered marines after them.  
You'll encounter 4 zerglings, nothing to worry about.  They should be easy to 
find, just head to the beacon on the minimap.  Grab them, grab the resource 
pads, then head back home.  Once there send 8 marines to garrison your two new
bunkers.  You will have a few waves of zerglings and flying units, but the 
bunkers and missile turrets should hold them back easily.  Build a reactor on
your second barracks and fill it with marines.  Make a few more medics from
the first barracks.  Make sure to continue to build supply depots to cover your
growing armies needs.

Near the 14 minute mark a second group of rebels will require your help.  Send
your troops to the beacon to the northwest, save the rebels, grab the 
resources, return home after the zerg wave hits you.  At this time you should
have enough spare resources to pay to upgrade your troops weapons and armor.
Do so at the engineering bay.  You should also want to double the number of 
missile turrets on your perimeter.

At roughly the nine minute mark the final group of rebels will call for help.
Do as before and send all of your non-bunkered forces to the beacon.  Save the
rebels, grab the resources, head home.

From here on out just keep repairing your bunkers and turrets, keep building
supply depots, and keep pumping out marines and medics.  Once the 20 minutes
pass you'll be done with the third and final prologue mission.  Head to the 
Hyperion, your Base of Operations for the rest of the game.



**************************************************
Mengsk - Mission 1.1 - The Evacuation
**************************************************


Primary Mission Objective: Evacuate the Agria Colony
Credit Reward: 100,000
Research Opportunities: +3 Zerg Research
Unit Unlocked: Firebat
Mercenaries Unlocked: Devil Dogs

In Mission Objectives
.....Reach Dr. Hanson's Settlement
.....Escort Colonists to the Colony Ships [50]

Bonus Objectives
.....Collect Chrysalis DNA [3][Research]


This mission starts you off by airdropping 2 firebats and 2 medics onto the 
planets surface.  Follow the road west verying north to grab a mineral and 
vespene pallet.  Make sure you only use attack-move for this section!  There 
are several zerglings hiding on your way to the base.

Once you reach the base you gain control of it.  A Command Center, Barracks 
with tech lab, supply depot, and refinery.  You also gain 5 SCV's.  I suggest 
queing up 5 more at the command center and 4 more marines at the barracks.  The
first convoy is already at your base and almost ready to go.  You should have 
just enough time to get 2-3 more marines out before it leaves.  FOLLOW IT!
Make a note as to where the two bunkers are, you'll want to send a compliment 
of marines to each as well as an SCV later.  Grab all of the resource pads as
you follow the convoy north.  Once you reach the platform take out the 
Chrysalis on the right side to gain your first zerg research point and unlock 
the Bonus Objective.  Then send all your troops back to the base.

NOTE: If you target the armored personnel carrier and have your troops "Move"
to it, they will auto-follow it and auto-attack. 

Once you return there will only be a short amount of time before the next 
convoy is nearly ready for you to guard them.  Start making your mass supply 
depots/marines/medics now.  You can add some firebats if you'd like, but make
sure to get enough marines to arm those bunkers.  Building an engineering bay
at this point would help also.  You should also have enough marines to fill the
bunkers.  Do so, and remember to get SCVs to them to repair them.

Before the third convoy is ready send your troops to the first bunker.  Have
them go down the hill to the west of the bunker and into the fields.  Here you
will find your second Chrysalis.  Let the convoy catch up to you and follow it
north to the platform.  On your way back to your base take the only eastern 
path and follow it south to another field and your third and final Chrysalis.
Resturn to the road and send an SCV to that same eastern exit to build a bunker
thus covering the third entrance to the road.

By now you should have strong enough of a force and medics to continue to 
escort 2-3 more convoys and end the mission.



**************************************************
Artifact - Mission 1.2 - Smash and Grab
**************************************************

Primary Mission Objective: Seize the Xel'Naga Artifact
Credit Reward: 110,000
Research Opportunities: +4 Protoss Research
Unit Unlocked: Marauder
Mercenaries Unlocked: Hammer Securities

In Mission Objectives
.....Get to the Artifact

Bonus Objectives
.....Find Protoss Relics [4]


Your base starts this mission with a Command Center, Merc Compound, Barracks
with a Tech Lab, a refinery, and two supply depots.  You also start with 1 
Medic, 3 marines, and 5 SCVs.  As always put those SCVs immediately to 
gathering minerals from the 8 mineral deposits.  You'll need 3 more SCVs mining
minerals, 3 more for the refinery, and 1 more as a builder/repair SCV.  Mere
moments into this mission you have 4 marauders air dropped onto you base just 
as 3 protoss stalkers start making their way to your base.  Build 2 more medics
to go with your now strong force.  You'll need to start building extra supply
depots very soon.  Que up 4-5 more marauders at your barracks.

Take your small force north of your base and grab the first Protoss Relic.  
This reveals your bonus objective for this mission.  Have your troops move east
taking out pylons as they go to unpower the protoss photon cannons.  Be 
prepared for an early incoming zerg attack from the west as well.  You should
be able to see the second protoss relic just west of your base.  Head that way
and aquire it.  Use hit and run tactics to take out each cannon, falling back
to heal as needed.  There are two cannons and a stalker here that you must 
clear.  Grab the second relic and head back towards home.  

Pick up your extra troops trained from the barracks and head east again.  Go
ahead and make a bunker near your bases entrance and stock it with 4 marines.
Send the rest of your troops east into the next protoss area.  Again, take out
the pylons from a distance to disable the photon cannons.  Pick up the third
Protoss relic to the southwest of your eastern path.  Now, approach the Protoss
base to the east.  Take out troops first, pulling them back from the cannons.
Next take out pylons that will disable cannons or cannons first if you cannot 
reach the pylons.  8-10 marauders with 3-4 medics will clear this base easily.
Once the base is clear head dead east to obtain the fourth and final Protoss
Relic.  Then north to the Artifact rally point.

Once you reach the Rally point, the stone statues around you come to life and 
attack you.  These stone zealots are an easy opponent if you have the dozen 
marauders and 4 medics.  Congratulations, another mission down.

Post Mission: At this point you should have unlocked the Laboratory and have 
access to the Tier I Zerg Research.  I highly suggest researching the Shrike 
turret as our SCVs keep our bunkers at full life without needing a + Life 
bonus.  This guide will assume that you take each suggested research option.



**************************************************
Mengsk - Mission 2.1 - Outbreak
**************************************************

Primary Mission Objective: Investiage the Meinhoff Infestation
Credit Reward: 110,000
Research Opportunities: +2 Zerg Research
Unit Unlocked: Hellion

In Mission Objectives
.....Cleanse the infestation [150]

Bonus Objectives
.....Kill the Infestors


You base starts this mission with a Command center, refinery, 2 barracks, a
merc compound, 4 supply depots, and a Sensor tower.  You also begin with 
4 firebats, 6 marines, 4 medics, and 6 SCVs.  As usuall que up 5 scvs.  Add in
2 more marines so that you'll have 8.  Set one scv to building a bunker at your
bases northeast and northwest entrances.  Once completed fill them with 
marines.  Have your newly made SCVs fill out the slots for mining minerals and
gathering vespene gas.  By now it should be nighttime and the first wave of 
zerg should be coming.  Go ahead and set your remaining firebats and medics 
near the bunkers but have them hold position.  Otherwise they will chase the 
zerg and eventually run outside the bunkers range.  Build second bunkers when
you get the chance.  Even though you can't fill them yet, they'll be there 
waiting and you should have researched the turrets so the empty bunkers can 
still fight.

Halfway through the first "night" you'll be reinforced when 4 hellions and a
factory are airdropped in.  THese babys are firebats on wheels and take out 
zerg swarms easily.  GO ahead and set the factory up with a reactor, and if 
your barracks are open set one up with a tech lab and one with a reactor.  By
now you should also start cranking out thos supply pads.

Once Daylight hits send ALL your troops, even those in bunkers, to the 
northeast entrance of you base and have them head north.  All the zerg are
hibernating so you won't need to keep your bunkers full.  Start slaughtering
this nest asap.  While your troops go free-for-all on the defenseless nest,
put a full que into your reactor laden factory of hellions.  Once the first 
full "day" is over you should have a dozen hellions ready for the following 
day.  at the 1:30 marker send your marines back to their bunkers.  You can 
burn a few more buildings to the west if you'd like, but make sure to head home
at around 40 seconds.  This will give an scv time to repair the hellions and 
the firebats time to set up their "hold" positions again.  Keep the factory 
going constantly.  As soon as the armory is done research both the vehicles
weapons and armor upgrades.  Plan to build a bunker to the south soon as that
entrance won't be safe after the third night comes.  You secondary objective 
will pop up here as well.  

By now you should have 16-20 Hellions.  Leave all your other troops at home for
the second "day" except 1 scv.  Send the hellions and scvs to the northwest.
Start clearing out the west side of the map with your hellions.  You should be 
able to clear the west side all the way down to your first Infestor beacon and
the very edge of the large zerg nest at the southern border.  Do not engage 
there just yet.  Head back home before nightfall, but remember this general 
area.  We'll be coming back and building bunkers near this Large Zerg nest on 
the third "day."  Make sure you start making a small marauder squad.  10 should
do it.  Otherwise just sit back for the third night and keep your bunkers 
repaired while building up more troops for the next nest strike.  Also start 
calling in your War Pigs from the Merc compound.  We'll use them in our
southern bunkers near the zerg base.

Once the third "day" starts rush your SCVs and War Pigs down to the southern
edge of the zerg base.  Send your hellions to the northeastern part of the map
and have them start working their way south along the eastern edge of the map,
Just like they did the west side.  Once the bunkers are built to the far 
southwest get your war pigs inside and build another sensor tower near them.
You should have enough time to start setting up bunkers on the far southeast
entrance to the main zerg base.  Do so and get them packed with war pigs and
marines.  Build another sensor tower.  You should now have no trouble with your
main base as all the "night" troops must come from the southern zerg base.  If
you succed in this than place all your marauders, firebats, and medics near the
southwestern bunkers and all your hellions just west of the southeastern 
bunkers, at the third ramp to the zerg base, for the fourth "night" invasion.
While you now have the zerg trapped go ahead and empty your bunkers to the 
north.  Send those marines to the south/central ramp and build a bunker there
as well.  The next "Day" you will be ready to finish off the zerg and achieve 
your bonus objective.

Now that it's once again daytime, send all your forces south into the zerg 
base.  If you are fast enough you could destroy the entire base before the next
nightfall but do NOT do so. Destory structures until you are given the notice
that you are almost done and the last few structures show up on your map.  At 
this time send half of your ground forces to the far southwest and the other 
half to the east.  THe Infestors that you need to slay for your bonus objective
only come out at night.  Kill them and then either wait for day or send your
forces to the final few zerg structures.  Destroy them to finish the mission.

After the mission, if you have not yet done so, head to the Armory.  Research 
the concussive shells for the marauders, the stabalizing medpacks for the 
medics, and the Neosteel for the bunkers.  Also hire Hammer Securities as 
mercenaries in the Cantina.



**************************************************
Artifact - Mission 2.2 - The Devil's Playground
**************************************************

Primary Mission Objective: Exploit resources on Redstone
Credit Reward: 110,000
Research Opportunities: +3 Zerg Research
Unit Unlocked: Reaper

In Mission Objectives
.....Gather 8000 Minerals

Bonus Objectives
.....Locate Tosh's Miners
.....Kill the Brutalisk


You begin this mission with a Command Center, Barracks, Merc Compound, and 3
supply depots.  You also start with 2 marines and 10 SCVs.  THe SCVs go to work
mining minerals automatically on their own this time.  Very shortly into the 
mission you are told that the lava is rising.  Move ALL of your SCVs away from 
the minerals and you'll see why the warning was sent.  You will have to deal 
with these lava surges for the entire mission.  Your goal here is to gather
8000 UNUSED minerals.  After the first lava wave receeds you will recieve an
airdrop of 4 reapers.  Start moving them out to scout for mineral and vespene
supply pads.  As usualy set up some SCVs in the que for your command center.
Start building a refinery and some medics.  Once you have a few medics you'll
get a warning about some missing friends.  Go check it out with all your 
forces.  Start building a force of 10 marauders.

Once you rescue the forces, send the new command center and SCVs southeast to
the minerals.  Keep an eye on that timer and prepare ahead to pull your SCVs
into the command center and have it liftoff.  Your command center is fine if it
is flying over the lava.  Have all your forces, now beefed up with the 
marauders, to head to the far southwest corner to kill the first brutalisk.
Pull back anytime you need to heal and move back in.  It should fall easily.

At this point you have two options.  Send your forces further east from the 
Brutalisk to continue killing zerg, or just hold back and defend while you 
gather all of the resources that have been revealed to you by Tosh.  Personally
I prefer to fight while I wait.  It does make the stage a little longer, but 
much more entertaining.  Send your forces to roughly the center of the map.
Then head south and up a ramp and start clearing zerg near you there.  There
are four more reapers to the southwest side of this zerg base.

Send your troops back to the center of the map and head east.  Go up the first
ramp you see to get 4 more reapers.  Head south on this new plateau.  Proceed 
to kill zerg.  While this is going on more your command centers to 2 new 
mineral fields as your first two should have run out by now.  Far to the south
whereyour troops are fighting is yet another squad of reapers.  Head northeast
killing zerg and their structures to find another reaper squad.  Headin north
your troops will reach another low lava zone.  There is a ramp to the northwest
and northeast.  These are the two final areas that hold zerg.  Clear them out,
rescue the reapers and sit back.  By now even casual mining should have hit 
8000.

Back at the Hyperion you should be able to access your Tier II Zerg research.
Head there and if you are following the suggested research options, choose the
Perdition Turret.



**************************************************
Mengsk - Mission 3.1 - The Great Train Robbery
**************************************************

Primary Mission Objective: Intercept Dominion Trains
Credit Reward: 110,000
Research Opportunities: +3 Zerg Research
Unit Unlocked: Diamondback


In Mission Objectives
.....Destroy Dominion Trains [8]
.....Don't miss 3 Trains

Bonus Objectives
.....Locate Diamondbacks [6]
Collect Defiler Bone Samples [3] Research Bonus


This stage can be very intense.  If you are having any trouble go through the 
next two Artifact missions and unlock the siege tanks.  Placed at certain loops
on this stage they are devastating.  That being said...

You begin this stage with a Command Center, Merc Compound, Barracks, Factory
with attached Tech Lab, and 3 supply depots.  You also start with 4 SCVs and 4 
marines.  Put 4 more SCVs into the que, that's all the resources you have for
now.  When those are made have them mine more minerals.  Almost immediately you
will be told about the diamondbacks in the area.  Send your marines to the west
to find the first one.  The first three are marked on your map for you.  The 
other 3 that you need to find to complete the bonus objective are not.  Make
sure to build a tech lab onto your barracks at this time.

Head north towards the second diamond.  When you go down the first ramp and are
almost onto of the diamondback you will notice a blue glow to it's right.  This
is a sample of Defiler Bone, you second bonus objective and the one needed to 
earn this stages research bonus.  Grab it, and then continue to the second
diamondback.  Grab the 2 mineral pads near the #2 Diamondback and then go 
northwest a bit to take out a few dominion troops.  From here head northeast to
find the first hidden diamondback.  Now send all your troops to the third 
marked diamondback.  The first train should either be coming now or within 
seconds.  Get ready to meet it, it will come from the far northwest corner and
will pass your base from the northside.  Simple wait for it by the area that 
you have already opened on your map from getting the first 4 diamondbacks.  It
will be an easy kill for the first train.  Attacking any portion of the train 
will damage the entire train.  While killing it start building some marauders 
and more supply depots.  Once the train is down gather the resources it drops
and send your troops back to your base.

Once they reach home, send those troops out the southwest ramp and you will
discover the middle train track.  Follow it east, watching the north side of 
the track.  Directly south of your refinery and north of the track you will
find the second defilers bones.  Move south from these bones and once you cross
the middle tracks look to your east and you will see a ramp.  Up this ramp you 
will find the 5th diamondback.  Grab it and start heading back to destroy the
second train.  It will have an escort of 6 dominion marines.  Take them out 
first, then gather the resources that the train drops once you destroy it.
Head back to the southwest entrance to your base.  Along the train tracks you
will notice another ramp only 1-2 seconds south of your own southwest ramp.  
Go up this ramp for the 6th and final diamond back.  Start training your own as
later in this mission one of the trains will move VERY fast.  After aquiring
the last diamondback head back to your base and expect an incoming attack.
Once the dominion forces are repelled immediately head south to the southern 
train tracks.  Dead south of your base is a place where the middle and southern
train tracks almost meet.  There is a large loop here and it is best to attack
the train from this loop.  Place your troops on the south side of the tracks.
Again, take out it's defenders which consist of 6 marines and 2 hellions, then
finish the train and gather the resources.  Heading slightly southeast, follow
the southern train tracks.  Watch to the west of the tracks and you will find
the third and final Defiler Bones.  This should be directly south of your base
if you are having trouble finding it.  Grab the bones and head north close to 
your base.  Build an armory and engineering bay and start upgrading your troops
while constantly buildings marauders and diamondbacks.  Make sure to eventually
get 5 medics and 2 SCV's to stay with your troops as well.

The Fourth train will enter from the middle set of tracks.  Head towards the 
loop in the middle tracks just southeast of your base.  This time 4 Firebats 
and 6 marines will accompany the train.  As always take out the troops then 
the train.  Gather the resources and send your troops home as another attack,
this time some firebats with goliaths, will hit home.  

The Fifth Train comes from the northern tracks so head there now.  Stay near 
the ramp down from your base to the north.  4 Firebats, 4 marines, and 2 
marauders will be it's escort this time around.  Take out the escort, destroy 
the train, gather the resources.  A dominion hit squad of a dozen marauders 
will head your way.  They will tear into your forces so expect to take some 
loses.  

The Sixth train will be the fast train.  It comes from the middle track.  Have
your troops prepared to hit it at the loop as usual.  With a large enough force
the speed will make no difference.  Expect some small attacks on your base
afterwards, but nothing like the marauder force.  By now your force should be 
about 16 marauders, 16 diamondbacks, 5 medics and 2 SCVs.

The Seventh train come from the north.  Send your forces there.  Destroy the 
fast moving train, gather the resources. 

The eigth and final train will come from the middle tracks.  Head to the loop
near your southwestern ramp and expect heavy resistance.  It should still fall
easily to your forces.  A Raven, 4 marines, 4 goliaths, and 2 siege tanks will
escort it.  Defeat them, destroy the train, and win the mission.

Research Opportunities: +3 Protoss Research
Unit Unlocked: Goliath


In Mission Objectives
.....Gather Terrazine [7]
.....Protoss Can't Seal 7 Altars

Bonus Objectives
.....Find Protoss Relics [3] Research Bonus



You start this mission with a Command Center, Merc Compound, Barracks, Factory
with a Tech Lab, an Engineering Bay, a Refinery, 2 supply depots, and a missle
turret.  You also start with 2 marines, 3 Goliaths, and 5 SCVs.  As usual set
your SCVs to gathering minerals, train all the SCVs you can until you have 1 
per mineral deposit, 3 for your refinery, and 2 additional.  One for building
and one for repairing.  For this mission you'll want to pump out Goliaths, 
Medics, and marauders. 

As much as you would like to do NOT send any SCVs to gather Terrazine gas yet.
You can buy yourself some more time to gather and produce troops if you wait
until the protoss contact you.  Use this time to build Goliaths, marauders, and
an armory to upgrade your goliaths.

The instant you start recieving an incoming transmission from the protoss send 
a single SCV to the western altar and gather the terrazine gas.  Send your 
forces and a second SCV to the trio of altars slightly to your northwest.  
Begin gathering from one of these altars while you protect your SCV.  After
you gather the terrazine follow the SCV home and gather your first Protoss 
Relic that is located inches north of your base, down the northern ramp.

Stop any protoss from sealing altars, but wait to strike out until you have 6 
Goliaths, 5 marauders, and 2 medics.  Once you have this force strike out at 
the protoss base north of your own base and north of the first protoss relic.
Remember to always take out Pylons that could power cannons first if possible.
When you first strike 2 Scouts, 1 stalker, 2 cannons, and a Void Ray will 
fight you.  Finish them and then move further in.  There will be 1 unpowered 
cannon, if you took out the pylons, and no other resistance.  Clear this area.
Afterwards head out the north ramp and take out the cannons, strikers, and 
scouts protecting the 3 altars here.  Afterwards Head east to stop the protoss
from sealing another altar.  If you still have your 2 SCVs with your force to 
repair set them both to gathering the gas from the two easternmost altars.  
Afterwards head back to the cleared protoss base.  

You should be constantly reinforcing your squad with more goliaths, marauders, 
and medics.  This will be a slow producing stage, so make sure to keep medics
and SCV's around to keep your troops alive.  By now you should have 4/7 altars
gathered.  The trio north of the cleared area will be your final three.  But 
before gathering them let's get the other two protoss relics.

Head northeast from the cleared protoss base, and north of the trio of altars
on the east side.  You still start to see some cut stone pavement.  Follow this
northeast and you will face 4 Zealots and 2 cannons.  Then move in and claim 
the relic.

Next head northwest of the cleared protoss base, to the near trio of altars.
Continue further west past this trio, to the west side altars.  Here you will 
find the last relic out in the open.  Fly your command post to the trio of 
altars northwest of the cleared base.  Land it there and send all your forces 
to it.  Have your SCVs start gathering the terrazine and wait for victory.


Back at the Hyperion you should be able to access your Tier I Protoss research.
Head there and if you are following the suggested research options, choose the
Vanadium Plating.

.....Buy Merc Contract Before Orlan [6000 minerals]

Bonus Objectives
.....Find Protoss Relic Contraband [3] Research bonus


At the beginning of this mission your base and troops are airdropped in.  You
start with a Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Merc Compound, and 2 Supply 
Depots.  You also start with 5 marines and 5 SCVs.  Start by queing up 5 SCVs
and 2 medics, then have you marines start gathering crates in your base area to
get resources.  Have them move out the northern exit and gather more resources.
Do NOT engage troops to the north until you have a medic.  Once you clear the 
first set of marines you should have 4 vultures dropped in.  Add them to your
forces and head to the northern Orlan base marked on the map.  Start queing up
Vultures and Marauders at this point.  Get an SCV with your forces to repair
the vultures.  The first base should fall easily, then start gather the 
resources in the area and to the west.  Also note that the salvaged scrap just 
west of the now destroyed command center.  Destroy it to reach your first 
Protoss Relic.  Head back to your base and exit the southwest side.  Destroy 
the downed ship near this exit and claim your second protoss relic.

With 5 more vultures added to your forces from production, head to the southern
base marked on your map.  A few marines and a single medic will be your only
resistance.  Kill them and then destroy the Command center and SCVs.  Make a 
loop south then west then north to put you between the base you just destroyed
and the third base southwest of your base.  Here you will find the third
salvaged scrap that you need to destroy to reach your third Protoss relic.

Afterwards invade the third and final gathering base of Olrans.  Again you'll 
face a few marines with a medic, but also a goliath.  By now you should have a 
distinct mineral advantage over orlan.  Start building up the marauder forces.
Add in some goliaths for anti-air, and keep your medics handy.  Keep your heavy
slow forces at home and send the vultures out to continue gathering all the 
resources they can.  Eventually you'll hive 6000 minerals and buy your merc
contract.

Once you have the new larger force gather all of your troops and head for 
Orlans primary base.  Clear it out and finish the stage.

Back at the Hyperion you should be able to access your Tier II Protoss 
research.  Head there and if you are following the suggested research options,

You start this stage with 2 medics, 4 marines, and 1 marauder being airdropped 
in to the west.  Make your way south along the path.  You'll quickly encounter
2 zealots and a striker.  Further south you'll have two siege tanks dropped in.
Manually target the pylon with them, and then let them take out the cannons.
Head east and once you see the striker set the siege tanks up on the ridge.  A
second striker will follow so wait until he does before uprooting your tanks.
Afterwards move north along the path and claim your base.

You'll start with a Command Center, a Merc Compound, Barracks, a Factory with
a tech lab, an engineering bay, and 3 supply depots.  You'll also gain 7 SCVs.
Immediately set them to work on gathering minerals.  Fill your command centers
que with more SCVs.  Set up one siege tank in siege mode at the top of the 
north exit from your base and the second at the top of the east exit from your
base.  Once you have 2 more siege engines give each of the original 2 a backup.

Start queing up marines until you have 12.  Make a bunker at the top of each of
your bases exits.  Fill them with the marines.  Afterwards slowly start pumping
out goliaths and marauders.  At some point go ahead and make a 3rd pair of
siege tanks to support your previous 2 pairs, all the while making supply
depots for your growing army.

When the Temple Door has taken about 24k in damage, you will be given manual
control over the laster.  Simply click it and then right click and protoss in 
your visible range to have it target them.  It can target anything on the map
if you can see it.  Remember this when you attack buildings.  Continuing the 
slow troops production until you have 2 medics, 6 marauders, and 3 goliaths.

Once you have this force head southeast out of your base to the open area with
visible minerals and vespene geyser.  Head past it slightly to encounter a 
protoss cannon and pylon.  Take them out and continue to the end of the path,
veering slightly south and up a ramp to a Xel'naga shrine.  You'll then recieve
a message and your bonus objective.  Use the Laser Drill to destroy it and 
retrieve the protoss relic.  Head back down the hill to the next shrine and 
destroy it also gathering the protoss relic.  Send your force back to your base
and then northwest to the third and final relic.  You'll encounter another
protoss cannon and pylon at the third shrine.  Destroy them, recover the relic
and head back to your base.

At this point conserve your resources, and watch for incoming attacks.  Use the
drill when necessary.  For the most part you won't be using your ground based
attack force anymore except for a little added defense.  It's really WAY too 
difficult at this point to try and charge a protoss base.  They are heavily 
defended by cannons and troops.  Ignore attacking minor troops with the drill.
You only need to kill the archons and the troop transports.  Your 3 siege tanks
and single bunkers with 6 marines should easily handle all other forces thrown
at you.  Once they start sending Colossus at you target them with the drill as 
well.  Keep at it like this and the door will fall in time.

In this mission you will be controlling only Tosh.  There will be backup from
Raynors Raiders, but only Tosh will be under your direct control for the 
entire mission.  Move Tosh forward and take out the 3 dominion marines.  Then
continue to the north and use Toshs' Mind Blast on the group of marines there.
Finish them off with single shots and proceed through the entrance.  Use your
mind blast again on the 3 marines in front of the turret.  Then finish them
with single shots.  Then take out the rear marine and finish the turret.  Move
Tosh further north and to the northern edge of the next turrets sight range.
Put up Toshs Psi-Shield and quickly take out the siege tank and the other 2
marines.  Then take out the turret.

Now Raynor will start to send troops forward.  Move Tosh up the ramp to take
out the siege tank.  Then start working on the bunker and the marines inside
that are near you.  After that move in with the next friendly patrol.  The
medic will heal tosh.  Use this to your advantage to take out the next bunker
and marines.  There will occasionally be a group of dominion forces consisting
of 6 marines and a medic.  When they pass mind blast them.  Once the bunkers
are down take out the turret.  Then move north to take out the next turret, but
only when you have backup as there will be 2 hellions.  Leave raynors troops to
finish off the factory and move forward.  A ghost will drain you of your 
energy.  Take him out and then head back and use consumption on a maruader.
There will then be a large force of troops and some bunkers airdropped in.

Wait for the next wave of troops to move forward.  There is a bunker, 2 siege 
tanks and a turret ahead.  Once the next wave comes through quickly move in
and take out the turret.  Then move forward and take out the siege tanks and
the hellions guarding them.  Move northwest into prison block A.  Use 
mindblast to take out the ground troops then Psi-Shield and move in to take out
the turret.  Finish the siege tank off and watch the prisoners escape into the
diamondbacks.  Head back and southwest, go up the first ramp you see.  Head
south and watch for a raven.  Wait for it to path away and then take out the
siege tank located nearby.  Now you can safely take out the raven.  Now head
back and down the ramp, then follow raynors forces south.  If the bunkers are
gone use your psi-shield to take out the next turret then the siege tank south
of the turret.  Move further south, but this time let your fellow troops take
out the siege tank.  Then move in and eliminate the turrety.  Another large
force will be airdropped in at this position.

Head far west to reach Cell Block B.  Here you'll find 2 siege tanks, 4 
marines, a medic, a marauder, and lastly a raven.  Wait for the raven to head 
north and when it does run to a niche in the southeast that is out of the
ravens path and line of sight.  Pick off the siege engine here and then
mindblast the troops.  Then use your psi-shield and rush the siege tank.  After
that take out the ciking and the remaining raven.  Now watch as the prisoners
commandeer some siege tanks of their own.

Head northeast and meet up with raynors troops.  You'll have access to nukes
now.  Drop one right between the turret and bunker to the north.  Now you're
ready to enter the main prison base.

Crawl in and take out the siege engine to the left.  Then drop a nuke on each 
of the visible turrets.  This should take out all the local troops with the
turrets.  Drop your fourth nuke on the turret at the top of the next ramp.
Move up and drop your final nuke on the Planetary Fortress.  Mop up the 
remaining troops with the help of Raynors Raiders and the mission is complete.

For this mission you will control 12 marines, 2 medics, and Nova a unique 
ghost.  Move your marines and medics forward and take out the bunker and the 
marines it houses while taking the necessary loses.  Keep moving and take the
ramp to your right up.  Kill the marines, marauder, and missle turret there.

Have Nova move to the east.  Snipe the marauder then take out the 3 marines 
past it.  Take out the gate controls to the north.  Then have your first squad
meet up with Nova.  Have Nova move north alone to take out a medic and 2 
marauders.  If they run up the ramp do not follow.  When ready to head up the
ramps send all your troops up.  There are 2 marauders, 2 marines, and 2 missle 
turrets waiting for you at the top of the ramp.  Move forward and dominate the
siege tank as instructed.  Let it take out the turret, then move forward and 
destroy the Raven.  Move on and Nova will get stunned by a spectre.  Somehow
she is permanently cloaked yet the spectre sees her... and then he doesn't see
her as she moves in to kill him.  Ah story mode.

Move up the next ramp cautiously as there is a turret, spectre, and a 
battlecruiser waiting at the top.  You should be able to snipe the spectre.  
Then bring your siege tank up to hit the turret.  Finally sacrifice you siege 
tank by bringing it uphill and taking out the second turret further north.
This will alert the battlecruiser who still kill your tank, but it will free up
Nova to kill the cruiser from stealth.  Destroy the Jorium stockpile.  
Cutscene then new map.

Nova drops in here alone.  Hold your ground as a partol moves in.  Step out 
long enough to dominate the raven.  Move it away quickly so the 2 marines do 
not kill it.  Then let Nova snipe the marines and lone marauder.  Use the Raven
to scout ahead of you and keep Nova safe from turrets.  Head west with nova and
take out the 2 marines there. Then move south and take out the two vikings
allowing your back up to be airdropped in.  Another Raven, 8 Reapers, and 2
Siege Tanks.  Send your two ravens over the gate.  You will see the gate 
control to the west.  Moving closer you'll see a siege tank in siege mode, 
2 marines, and a turret.  Instead of having the reapers jump over and suicide
rush the siege tank, send your two ravens in and have them use their missle 
attack on the siege tank.  THEN send in your reapers.  This way you should lose
no troops.  To the northwest is a bunker.  This time move your siege tanks up
and have them destroy it and the turret behind it from range.

Past these to the north is a siege tank on a platform.  Take it out with Nova.
Then move your siege tanks to the bottom of the ramp, set up siege mode, and 
blast the hellions and missle turret to shreds.  2 ground based vikings will
also move into range but the tanks should handle them as well.  Leave your
troops at the base of the ramp and move a raven forward.  This will trigger a 
nuclear launch.  Simply back the raven up to your troops and wait out the 
strike.  Send your reapers up to the platform on the east and take out the 2
marines and turret there.  Move your siege tanks forward to take out the 
upper bunker.  then forward and up the ramp to your north to take out the 
turret, 2 firebats, and medic near the green beacon.  Move a raven near where
the turret was.  Have it move dead west avoiding the turret to the north and 
southwest.  A spectre will show up.  Send a missile at him.  Then have Nova
move to the beacon.  Once the nuke is ready send Nova up the final ramp.  Stop
near the top and launch the nuke directly onto the 5th spectre.  This will also
take our the Terrazine tank.

The third and final map will have Nova accompanied by 4 Banshees and 4 vikings.
Send the Banshees southeast to take out the siege tank on high ground.  Then
send Nova up the ramp and have her snipe the Firebat waiting there.  Take out 
the turret from long range then proceed to eliminate the 2 marauders, 
1 hellion, and 1 viking to the west.  Move east and dominate the raven you find
there quickly moving it out of harms way.  Have Nova then finish the 2 
marauders and 2 marines there.  Clear the rubble to the south and watch the 
freed Ultralisk head east and take out two turrets and a dozen marines for you.
Move up and shoot the ultralisk once and it will head east to take out another
turret for you.  Finish off the Ultralisk then attack the Thor to the south.

Now backtrack to where the siege tank was.  Move north and take out the turret
and spectre there.  Then have you raven move forward and missile the goliath.
This will draw it south where Nova can finish it off.  Move Nova north and take
out the next turret.  You'll see a raven patrol here.  Move your raven east to
the nearest spectre.  A nuclear launch will be detected.  Drop a autmoated 
turret next to the spectre.  He will ignore it while it kills him.  His friends
will attack the turret, and the nuke will land killing your Raven.  Now 
dominate the patrolling Raven.  Move Nova forward to take out the auto-turret
and then the bunker.  Have the Raven drop an auto turret near the 2 marines and
viking guarding the turret behind the bunker.  Keep nova close.  She and the
turret will make short work of the guards.  Then move her in to take out the 
missle turret and then the 2 auto-turrets to the east.  Now let Nova hack into
the Nuke silo.

Move Nova down the ramp until you see a Raven.  Have you vikings take it out.
Have your banshees approach the next spectre from the north.  They will take 
out the spectre, medic, and marauder there.  Then have you vikings land and 
move in to take out the missile turret and it's guards.  Now send in your
banshees to take out the turret that is blocking Nova from being able to nuke
the Psi-Indoctrinator.  After that place the nuke on the last two remaining
spectres which will also take out the Psi-Indoctrinator.  Watch the blast and
the mission is over.

If you choose to save the colonists you must fight the protoss and their 
Purifier.  You start this stage with a Command Center, Barracks, Factory, 
Starport, Merc Compound, an engineering bay, a refinery, and 3 Supply Depots.
You also start with 3 Vikings, 4 marines, and 6 SCVs.  Standard protocol here, 
set all the SCVs to mining minerals, que up enough SCVs in the Command Center
to cover each mineral deposit, 3 for the refinery, and 2 more for repairs and
building.  Build a Tech lab for both your barracks and factory while building a
reactor for your starport.  Once the reactor is done que up 2 vikings.  You'll
continue to que vikings and goliaths for the remainder of this mission.  
Continue to build supply depots to keep up with them as you go.

When the first terror fleet starts attacking the colonists evacuation ship send
in your vikings.  6-7 of then will make quick work of the carriers there.  
Start building a bunker to the southeast and southwest entrance of your base.  
Also build a few missile turrets near the bunkers.  A single sensor tower 
wouldn't hurt either.  Call in a siege breacker merc and set them up in siege
mode near the bunkers.  Once you fill the bunkers with marines you should have
all the defense you'll need for this mission.

Send your vikings and goliaths to the south side of the eastern protoss Nexus.
Lure out their flyers to be attacked by your flying vikings.  Then land and 
move in.  Only a few cannons and zealots will stand in your way.  Next move 
these troops to the nearest settlement to the southeast.  This is where the 
second terror fleet will strike soon so be there waiting.

Head to the southeast Nexus.  There will be a colossus here and a few stalkers,
but no cannons so you should be well preppared for this base.  Kill, clear, 
and move on.  Send your vikings to the last colonist base just southwest of
your own base.  This time around you'll face 3 carriers and a scout as the 
third terror fleet moves in.  Finish them and send all your forces to the 
final Nexus.  Have your two siege tanks take out the cannon from a distance.
There are 2 carriers here as well as an archon and warp ray so go in slow and
methodically.  Once this nexus is dead the purifiers shields go offline.  Send 
everything you have at it.  The purifier will warp out the first group you send
in so send in just 1-2 marines.  Afterwards it will warp in 2 scouts and 4 
stalkers.  Take them out then pound the purifier.  Once it falls your mission 
is complete.

So you've decided to cleanse the colony.  Oh for shame!!!
You start this stage with a Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Starport, Merc
Compound, a refinery, and 3 Supply Depots.  You also start with 3 Vikings, 4
marines, 2 firebats, and 6 SCVs.  As usual set the SCVs to mining while making
more SCVs at the command center until you have enough for each mineral deposit,
3 for your refinery, and 2 for building/repairs.  Add a reactor to your 
Starpoirt and a tech lab to both your barracks and factory.  Build 2 more 
vikings and 2 medics.  Set up a bunker to the north, where most of the zerg 
forces are coming from, and make sure to train and fill it with 6 marines.

Meanwhile send your 5 vikings to the zerg base east of you and have them take
out all the air forces there.  Then fly slightly south, land, and move in to
take out the land forces.  Clear the base then head back to your base for 
repairs.  Once the area is clear you'll be given a notice that the infestation
is moving to another location to the south.  Get repaired and head that way
while continually creating more vikings.  Draw the air units to you, then fly 
to the southeast side, land, and move in for the kill.  Set up a bunker and 
fill it with marines on the south side of your base.  Start upgrading your
starships weapons at the armory.

Continue the pattern of repair, upgrade, supply depots, and increasing the
number of your vikings while clearing out the zerg infestations.  Once you get 
about 20 vikings moving with you the rest of the stage should just be move,
kill, clear, wrinse, repeat.  Be wary as the far eastern zerg infestion does
have spore crawlers that are deadly to your vikings when they are in the air.
Just be careful in the early stage not to lose too many vikings, while you are
building up your primary force of them and this stage will be a snore.

You have no direct control over Tychus for this mission.  He will run rampant
throughout the stage.  Try to keep up with him for the first half until he
steals the Odin.  You start with 5 marines and 2 medics.  The medics can also
heal Tychus so stay with him at all times!

Follow tychus northeast into the base.  You'll encounter 5 and then 4 marines
that drop quickly to Tychus' chaingun.  Your first Devourer tissue sample is
shortly northwest into the base.  Grab it before moving further in.  Follow 
Tychus lead to 3 more marines and 2 perdition turrets.  Pull back to heal if
needed, Tychus can handle the turrets alone.  Follow him to the final room and
kill 3 marines, 1 firebat, and 1 marauder.  Tychus will then enter the Odin
battlearmor and blast his way out.  This is where the mission truely begins.

Your base will be airdropped in consisting of a Command Center, barracks, Merc
Compound, Factory, a bunker and 4 supply depots.  You'll also gain 3 more 
marines and 6 SCVs.  Immediately set the command center to make more SCVs and 
send two to the Odin.  As long as you keep those two alive they will keep the 
Odin alive for the entire mission.  Send your marines to fill the bunker.

Shortly after 2 battlecruisers will be sighted heading for the Odin.  You'll
then recieve 4 wraiths.  Use them to destroy the battlecruisers.  Pull back if
they get too damaged and let the SCVs repair them.  Keep them behind the Odin
and let the battlecruisers engage him before moving in for the kill.

The Odin will quickly move north to the first dominion base.  Follow it with 
your 2 SCVs and 4 Wraiths.  Build a Tech lab for your barracks, factory, and 
starport.  Build 4 vikings while the Odin takes out that base.  After finishing
the base Tychus will take a break.  Make sure your SCV is still alive and move
any new troops to his side, while grabbing any resource pads along the way.
When you have time build an engineering bay and armory.  When you have the 
resources call in a Hel's Angels squadren.  Your should now have a decent
anti-air force to carry with the Odin.  

Tychus will head to the next base northeast of where he stopped for a break.
Follow him and provide what little support he might need.  Inside this base on 
the northeast wall you'll find your second Devourer Tissue Sample.  Make sure
to repair your troops and then the Odin while waiting.

Follow Tychus to the third base.  He'll need more support this time than 
previously.  He'll also need more repairs.  Keep building anti-air units and
you'll provide him the perfect cover.  When Tychus takes his break after 
destroying the third dominion base head directly southeast of the Odin with
your flying squad and you'll discover the Loki.  Take it out to complete one of
your bonus objectives.  

Clear the fourth base just like the previous ones.  Let Odin take the 
frontlines while providing him support and SCV healing.  Once cleared head to
the northwest exit from this base and you'll find your third devourer tissue
sample.  

Take a break, build more vikings for anti-air, then follow Tychus to the fourth
base.  As long as you can take out the first 2 battlecruisers you'll make quick
work here.  After that Tychus drops a nuke on the final base clearing it very
fast.  Congratulations, mission accomplished.

Back at the Hyperion you should be able to access your Tier IV Zerg research.
Head there and if you are following the suggested research options, choose the

In Mission Objectives
.....Destroy the Data Cores [3]
.....Kerrigan Must Not Access a Data Core

Bonus Objectives
.....Kill the Brutalisk [research]


You'll start this mission with a Command Center, Baracks, Factory, Starport, 
Merc Compound, a Refinery, and 2 Supply Depots.  You'll also start with no 
troops other than 5 SCVs.  Que as many SCV's as you can.  Shortly after 2 
Medivacs will fly in with 2 marines apiece.  Mere miliseconds later four more 
marines rush in being followed by 2 zerg and a FLYER.  Again mere seconds later
3 marines and a goliath appear on a rooftop to your southwest.  Have your 
Barracks, factory, and starport begin building Tech Labs.  Send the Medivacs 
to pick up the marines and goliath, but take 4 more marines with you.  Drop
them off on the same roof and destroy the Data core to the southwest.  Then
load up the medivac and head back to your base.  Build a bunker near the
southwest entrance to your base.  Build an Engineering Bay so that you can 
build missile turrets near your bunker.

Once you return a Nydus worm will approach the base south of the ramp.  Send 
your forces to kill it.  Then move them northwest along that path killing zerg
until you reach the next set of trapped marines.  Again send some extra 
marines with the medivacs, drop them off on the platform with the other marine
and goliath, and then attack the sporecrawlers nearby giving you a safe fly 
through zone for your medivacs.  Send your troops home for now and fill your 
bunker.  Start building a couple goliaths, 6 marauders, and 2 medics.  Also 
build your second refinery and 3 more SCVs to gather from it.  Continue 
building supply pads as well.  Build a 3rd medivac.

Once you have your mini attack force, load them up in the medivacs and head 
west through the area you cleared.  Land on the landing southwest of the next
data core and move to it clearing the zerg along the way.  You'll know you've
reached the right landing zone if you spot 2 more marines and 2 marauders
waiting for you to pick them up.  Be ready to send some SCV's to the second
data core location if you plan to continue harvesting.  Build a second command
center here and a third refinery.  Build SCVs to accompany it for gathering.

Continue building troops, supply depots, and upgrades until you have 12
Marauders, 6 goliaths, and 4 medics.  If you've researched the Hercules
construct one of them as well.  Once you have these troops (I suggest get all
the mercs you can for the marauders and goliaths) pack them up in your Hercules
or medivacs and head for the red beacon.  This will be the Brutalisk.  Dump
all of your troops onto the platform and watch them slaughter the Brutalisk.
Then load them all back up and head north.  Dump your troops on the other side
of the water and have them start moving towards the final data core.  After
clearing two Hydralisks move further in and you will see two more groups of 
troops on rooftops wanting rescue.  Do so, add them to your larger squad and 
keep moving.  Once you reach the final data core a few Nydus worms will pop and
send small waves of troops at you.  Fight them off while destroying the data
core for another easy mission victory.

You start this stage as the Odin again, and only controlling the Odin.  Start
by taking out all the forces on the central plaza with you.  Then head to the
Southeast base from the southern entrance.  Clear as much as you can while
following the main road.  Take it to the northern base and clear as much as you
can while you still have the element of surprise.  You'll have 5 minutes to do
as much damage as you can.  Your primary targets are units and unit producing
structures.  Everything else should be ignored for now.

Once your five minutes are up you'll gain control of Raynors base to the south.
You'll start with a Command Center, Barracks, Factory with tech lab, Merc
Compound, Refinery, Armory, and 4 Supply Depots.  You'll still have the Odin
and this time under your control.  You'll also gain 4 marines and 7 SCVs.  Set
them to work mining minerals and a full que of SCVs from the Command Center.
Moments later you'll have a Thord air dropped to your location.  Leave the Thor
at home to protect your base.  Set up a bunker to the north and 2 missile
turrets while sending the Odin and an SCV back to the eastern dominion base to
finish the job you started earlier.  While the Odin works on clearing that base
build an engineering bay and a few more supply depots.  Add on the tech lab to
your barracks.  Build some missile turrets along the northern wall of your 
base.  By now the Odin should have cleared the eastern base.  Send him towards
the northern base from there.  Get a Starport going with a tech lab and start
pumping out those vikings.  Just like before the Odin should be able to clear
out the Northern base by himself with some SCV repairing support.  Once done
move on to the western and final base.  While doing all this make sure to never
step on one of the beacons with the Odin.

Once Odin has cleared the entire map finish off your force if you haven't 
already.  10 vikings, 10 goliaths, 10 marauders, 3 medics, and 3 SCVs should be
enough for what you'll need.  Slowly move the force to each beacon.  Wait for
the timer to count down while defending against all attacks.  Then move to the
next beacon.  Do this twice and then send your vikings to the far southeast 
corner of the map.  Destroy the Starport you find there.  Have you vikings
land and then retrieve the secret documents.  Move the vikings back with the
rest of the attack force and finish the final beacon to complete this mission.

You begin this mission with 4 Banshees.  Circle around the small map you start
with scouting the area.  Near the center is a Pylon and stalker.  Cloak your
banshees and take out the pylon, then the stalker.  Uncloak, finish scouting
the perimeter, then move in to the beacon.  When you move on the beacon come in
from the southeast or northwest and take out the pylon charing the two cannons.
Then take out the disabled cannons.  Make sure the entire map is exposed before
killing the last cannon.  This will give you more map coverage when your base
is set before you have a time limit due to the encroaching fires.

A Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Starport, Merc Compound, and 2 refinerys.
You will not need any supply depots for this mission and you have the maximum
200 supplies available from the start.  You also gain 4 marines, 2 marauders,
and 6 SCVs.  Immediately set your SCVs to mining and que up 5 more.  Once
those 5 are done que up 4 more.  6 of them will go to the refineries (3 per)
and the remaining 3 will be for repairs and building.  Send your banshees to 
the small protoss platform directly to your east.  Clear the area then send in
your ground troops to gather the Protoss Relic.  Send your Banshees north, 
veering slightly east, to reach the second Protoss Relic.  Clear out the 2
Stalkers, 2 cannons, zealot, and the pylon that are guarding the relic.  Then
send in your ground troops to retrieve it.

By now you should have enough resources to start cranking out more Banshees.
Do so until you have 8-10.  When you are ready head dead east of your base with
your banshees.  You will encounter a protoss base.  Clear it out with your
banshees.  There are 2 cannons on the west side with a stalker.  Take out the
stalker from a distance then as usualy take out the pylon.  There are a few 
more stalkers with some zealots and a collusus, but they should pose no threat
to your banshee force.  If you'd like to speed things up a bit send 6 banshees
and have a few SCVs waiting east of the first relic.  Strike and withdrawl for
repairs while waiting on more banshees to be produced.  Call in a Hel's Angels
viking squad before you abandon the first base and the Merc Compound.

Quickly move all your structures to this near base area.  Set your SCVs up to 
make 2 more refineries over the geysers.  Build a tech lab for your starport,
barracks, and factory.  Get back to pumping out Banshees.  Move your Banshees 
southwest of you new base and clear out the 3 sentires and 3 stalkers there, 
then send in a ground troop to pick up the third protoss relic that you find 
there.

Send your banshees cloaked to the east and take out the 2 sentires and 2 
archons that you find there.  Head further east bringing your vikings and SCVs,
but keep them back for support.  Hit the next protoss base carefully, pulling
back if any scouts show up and let your vikings take them out.  Clear the base
out using this tactic until there are no flyers left defending it.  Then send
your force in full.  Head dead east from this base to find your fourth and
final Protoss Relic guarded by a cannon and a stalker.

Move your force northeast towards the beacon using the same tactic that you've
employed so far.  Move in slowly with banshees supported by vikings and SCVs
close behind.  Methodically clear out any anti-air units then move in full
force.  Once the final base is clear take out the vault itself and enjoy 
another mission victory.

You start this mission with 3 battlecruisers.  Fire a yamato blast at the first
stalker that you can see.  2 more will come within sight, take them out with
regular shots then move into the first rip field and head for the generator.
Use your remaining two yamato shots to weaken it quickly then finish it off
with regular shots.  Afterwards you base will be dropped in.  You'll start with
a Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Starport, Merc Compound, Fusion Core, 
Refinery, and 4 Supply Depots.  You'll also gain 5 SCVs.  Have them start
mining minerals immediately while queing up 5 more SCVs at the Command Center.
You'll have 7 more Rip Field Generators to take out before your can complete 
this mission safely.  Build a Tech lab for your barracks, factory, and starport
and have your new SCVs start gathering minerals.  Que up 3 more SCVs once the 
first 5 are produced.  You should now have the automated Refineries and no 
longer need SCVs to harvest vespene gas.  Have the new SCVs start producing
Supply Depots and slowly start cranking out Battlecruisers.  Build an armory so
that you can upgrade your battlecruisers weapons and armor.

Once you have 5 Battlecruisers build a Hercules or 2 medivacs.  Send the
battlecruisers to the edge of the next rip field and take out the cannons.  
Have an SCV start gathering the mineral shards and gas to the southwest of your
base and another SCV making an engineering bay.  We won't make many troop
upgrades from it but we may use the missile turrets and sensor towers.  Be sure
to clear out the two stalkers istting to the south of your base before your
SCVs get near them.  An archon and 2 zealots also guard more minerals and gas
to the south.  Move in and take out the second Rip Field generator and then
clear out what bases are now outside the remaining fields.  A cut scene will
pop up revealing your bonus objective.  4 yellow beacons that house protoss
defectors now show up on your map.  Free them at your leisure as you move west
taking out rip field generators.  Transport over at least 2 SCVs to where the
protoss base was just destroyed.  Build 3 automated refineries.  Upgrade your
starships weapons and armors to once at the armory.  Build a bunker at your
home base and house it with marines to ward off the small attacks aimed at 
your base.

Send your battlecruiser squad in the to next rip field generator just to the 
southwest of the previous protoss base.  Wip it out and then free the protoss
prisioners to it's northeast.  By now your original mineral fields and vespene
geyser should be depleted.  Lift up your base and move it to the first protoss
base area.  Land and start mining.  Have your hercules/medivacs transport your
SCVs over ot join the base.  Leave a single SCV behind with the marines in the
bunker for repairs and to defend your other structures.  Send your
Battlecruisers all the way south to the fourth rip field generator and take it
out.  Free the protoss prisoners to the east of the generator either before or
after destroying it.  These prisoners will need a transport off their platform.
Take caution on your way to the generator as there are 2 carriers and a void
ray waiting between the prisoners and the generator.

Head north to the next rip field generator.  Fend off the cruiser, void ray, 
stalkers, and archons that try and stop you.  Destroy pylons along the way to
slow down protoss reproduction.  Don't be ashamed to fall back for repairs once
or twice.  Keep your cruisers alive.  Take out the structures in the now opened
area, send in your SCVs to repair your cruisers, and continue making more
battlecruisers.  Head north to free the third group of protoss prisoners marked
on your map.  By now you should have at least 10 battlecruisers.  Keep them 
repaired and that is all you will need to finish this mission.  Head to the
south and destroy the sixth rip field generator, then backtrack east to free
the last of the protoss prisoners.

Now send your Battlecruisers to the far north.  There you will see a scout, 
3 cannons, and a pylon.  Kill the scout and take out the pylon to disable the
cannons.  Then head dead west to take out the seventh rip field generator.
Stay at the north and head to the far west corner, then south to take out the
last Rip Field Generator.  Here you'll face several scouts and carriers along
the way as well as a few sentries.  CLear them out then make your way south,
then east backtowards your SCVs to get repaired.  Once repaired head back in
and clear out all remaining Protoss opposition.  Beware getting too close to
the vault before you clear the area.  A Protoss Purifier awaits you there.
The Purifier will warp in several stalkers and carriers this time as well as 
warping several of your troops out of existance temporarily.  Once they return
use every yamato shot you have to weaken and destroy it.  Once the purifier is
destroyed move in and destroy the vault itself.  Another mission completed.

.....


I highly suggest you do either the secret mission or some or all of the Crystal
missions before tackling the final stages of the game.  Once you bagin mission
9.1 you cannot go back to do the crystal missions or the secret mission.  At 
this point you have not max'd out your research potential.  Take the time to do
so, especially the zerg research as either the Hive Mind Emulator or the Psi
Disruptor are very valuable in these last missions.

This mission will require a lot of time and patience as well as determination.
I suggest the first time you play it you lower the gamespeed 1-2 notches from
whatever you are used to.  A lot will be happeneing in a short amount of time.
You start this mission with a Command Center, Barracks, Engineering Bay, Merc
Compound, 2 Bunkers, and 1 missile turret.  Do not bother building a factory or
Starport as you will soon gain both.  You also begin play with 2 siege tanks, 
6 marines, 4 marauders, 4 medics, and 6 SCV's.  The normal still applies here
so que up 5 SCV's.  Then reposition your troops as you see fit.  Thankfully
this is another mission where you need not build supply depots and you already
have the max 200 supplies.  Grab the mineral and vespene pads near your north
bunker and then the same to the northest outside your base.  Start moving back
to your base and out the eastern ramp.  Then move north in preperation for the
first drop pods to land.  Move dead south and past your base.  Start clearing
out the zerg to the southeast of your base.  Then move to the Spore cannon and
destroy it making space for a second command center to be built.  The next drop
pod will fall almost on top of you to the north.  Rush your troops there to 
save the new recruits.  Build a Bunker and a Psi-Disrupter near your new base.
Have it start cranking out SCVs asap.  Fill the bunker.  Send the rest of your
forces west of your main base in prep for the third drop.

At the Third drop you'll find 3 Vultures and a factory.  Move the factory back
to your main base quickly.  Turn your troops around and head back to your base
as well.  Have the vultures grab the resources and vespene gas pads near the
drop and then head home as well.  Shortly after you get back to your base your
merc compound timers should be up.  Call in Jackson's Revenge as well as the 
siege breakers.  Send the siege breakers to your second base and set up siege
mode to defend.  Have your troops at home now head just slightly north of your
second base ready for the fourth drop pod.  This pod contains two siege tanks
and 4 more marines.  Send them with your main force directly north or your main
base.  Destroy the spore cannon you find there and then move slightly east.  
You'll know your in the right spot because there is no creep on the ground.
Send a small fource south, slightly southwest, of your main base and find 
another spot that has no creep.  Make sure you send Jackson's Revenge to the
southern location.  There will be an ultralisk there and the Yamato cannon will
help tremendously with that fight.  Shortly after this there will be a small
cutscene.  You'll have your next objective from that.

Use the Jackson's revenge and head northeast of your main base almost all the 
way north of your second base, just west of the first Nydus worm.  Use this
super battlecruiser to bust your way east to the nydus worms.  Once you get
there SCV's will repair you.  Take out the Nydus worms and you'll achieve
mission victory.

Primary Mission Objective: Sabotage the Zerg Defenses



In Mission Objectives
.....Plant Seismic Charges at each Fissure [3]
.....Run to the Extraction Point


For this mission you'll be in control of Raynor, Tychus, Swann, and Stetmann.
They are two marines, a marauder, and a medic.  Start by heading south along
the path.  You'll come up on your first group of zerg and be introduced to 
Raynors Penetrator round.  Use it to lethal effect and clean up after.  
Continue east until you near a ramp.  Use the penetrator round again, and again
clean up after.  head west until you reach a tight group of Zerg.  Tychus wants
in on the fun and here you use his Shredder Grenades.  Use it and then clean up
the left over zerglings.  Head up the next ramp and then south, whip out the
grenade again and while the remaining forces charge you get in a penetraing
shot.  Move south cleaning up after your mess.  south and then east down a ramp
and swann will be ready to show off his special moves.  Set up flaming betty.
If things get too crowded drop another shredder grenade, otherwise cleanup and
move on.  Eastward you'll find another ramp leading south, take out a tiny 
zerg force and you'll get your first notification of trapped marines you can 
save.  Use Penetraining shot on the class 5 zergling, then grenade the two
clustered spine crawlers, finish the third and head for the marines.

Head back to the main path and take a clockwise loop around.  When you hit the
end of the loop zeveral burrowed zerglings will pop up, but they pose no
threat.  As you head west you'll see multiple contacts.  Set up flamming betty
on the ramp, draw out the zerg, lob a grenade, and use pen shot on the class 5.
Head west and then down a northwestern ramp to engage 4 Nydus Worms up close
and personal.  Finish them off and move on to the beacon.

Once you plant the charge you'll need to defend it for 2:30 minutes.  Set up
flamming betty on one of the chosen locations and defend the rest.  Use
grenades on larger groups and pen shots on tougher foes.  Once the timer hits
00:00 a cutscene will show the effects and you'll automatically move on to the
next chamber.

Head east.  When you reach the infested toss a grenade into their midst.  Kill
the straglers and then pen shot the big guy.  Head south to the next group, and
take them out the easy way.  Very very close by you'll see a large group.  Set
up Flamming betty and if necessary toss a shredder grenade.  Follow the path
south and you'll reach another large group.  Use the same tactics as before to
move through here quickly.  Enter the chamber clearing out any structures.
Head south and an abomination will pop up to attack you.  Then after hitting
south and heading east some banlings will come.  Slowly pick them off from a
distance.  Rush down the eastern path to run headlong into two Nydus Worms
guarding 2 firebats and another medic.  Rescue them then face those behind you.

Next head northwest to the next 4 large groups of zerg.  What you actual see is
a group of Nydus Worms on a winding path.  Infested marines will constantly
flow down this path impeding your progress.  You must move than shoot then move
some more.  Keep this up as you head up the path and remember to use pen shots
and shredder grenades.  Once past this winding path you'll be at the second
fissure.  Plant the charge and wait out the arming phase for another 2:30.
The only change here is near the end 2 ultralisks will come.  Use a well placed
shredder to wipe them out.

On to the third and final map.  Head north and then way west.  fight off a
small wave of zerg and then follow the eggs.  When you hear the marines call
for aid get ready to drop it all.  When you see the ultralisk drop Flamming 
Betty immediately.  Use your shredder rounds to clear the way and then pen shot
the ultralisk.  Finish him off and gather your new reinforcements.  Head south
to the final beacon and a surprise finish.

Immediately attack-move towards the queen and pop out flamming Betty.  Then
toss your shredder grenade and pen shot at the queen.  She'll disapear briefly.
Follow her and repeat this process until she drops.  She'll disappear about 
3-4 times before you finish her.  In her last moments she starts using a stun
attack.  Don't fret too much this just means you almost have her dead.

Once the queen dies and the last charge is set int he final fissue, you'll
have to escape.  Run north on the 4th map.  THe path is very simple.  Take out
the first pack of zerg you see with standard attacks.  At the next section use
pen shot to take out two spine crawlers at once.  Keep clearing as normal.
The next big group will require a grenade and a pen shot to the infestor.
Pen shot the abomination in your path then skip all the rest heading for the
teh final beacon for escape.

You'll start this mission with a Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Starport,
Merc Compound, Engineering Bay, Refinery, and 5 Supply Depots.  You'll also
start with 8 marines, 3 medics, 2 banshees, a battlecruiser, and 8 SCVs.  For
once you'll only need to make 2 SCV's for building and repairs.  Build your 
second automated refinery, get tech labs made on your barracks, factory, and
starport, and get some banshees in que.

Send your battlecruiser southwest to the exposed zerg hive.  Start clearing it
slowly while you que up more banshees and troops.  You should be able to get 
all the way to the first coolant reactor and destroy it before needing repairs.
At home build a bunker to the west at the pass.  Pull your ships back after
you destroy the reactor and wait for it to blow.  Send over a viking merc squad
to clean up the resources left behind, they'll pay for themselves.  Set up a 
psi-disruptor and 2 missile turrets near the bunker to the north.

Since we love air fleets so much we'll tackle the northwest base first.  Take
your banshees and battlecruiser west of your base and take out the little hive
you'll find there.  Then continue west to the main hive guarding the coolant
reactor.  While you're at it get an armory up and start buffin those air units.
Call in a banshee merc squad and que a few more, we'll almost be at the limit
of our banshee needs.  Call in Jackson's Revenge when you're ready.  Slowly
work your banshees into the western colony.  Have your vikings and cruisers
sit right on top of the vents that release mutalisks.  Then methodically eat
away at the base until you reach the coolant reactor.  Blast it, get outa range
and watch the show!  

After the second reactor blows a Zerg Leviathan will show up.  Take at least
8-10 vikings and a few battlecruisers.  Even still be prepared to loose half 
of whatever you send.  The leviathan can attack and freeze your ships, 
afterwards they will have a fraction of their life left being easy prey for
incoming mutalisks.  Once it dies fly back to your SCVs for repairs.

Reinforce your air fleet and start building your ground troops.  Dozens of 
marauders and 4-5 medics should start nicely.  Once you have that send it and
your air fleet south of your base.  Clear out the mini hive and then move 
Barely south of the center of the map.  Clear out the mini hive here.  Then
send all of your marauders and medics to this newly cleared mini hive.

Send your marauders, goliaths, and medics into the southeastern base.  Slowly
kill everything on your way to the coolant tower.  Destroy it and run for the
hills.  Send all your troops to the entrance of the southwestern base.  
Reinforce them to full strength and then tear your way through everything to
the final coolant tower.  Destroy it and enjoy another mission complete.

Artifact - Mission 9.3  - All In
**************************************************

Primary Mission Objective: Sabotage the Zerg Defenses


In Mission Objectives
.....Defend the Artifact


Depending on which previous mission you selected you will have either waves of
Mutalisks and brood lords of waves of Nydus worms.  Simply change your ground 
or air defenses to match.  The rest of this mission goes the same whichever
you chose.

You'll start with nearly everything you need on this mission, structure wise.
A Command Center, Barracks, Factory, Starport, Armory, Engineering Bay, Fusion
Core, Merc Compound, 4 Bunkers, and 17 Supply Depots.  You'll also start with
a decent sized force.  18 marines, 5 marauders, 6 marauders, 4 medics, 2 siege
tanks, 3 banshees, 2 battlecruisers, and 23 SCVs.  Set up every SCV you can to
mining minerals, should be 16 mineral deposits.  Afterwards get tech reactors
on your barracks, factory, and starports.  Set up Psi-Disruptors near your 
bunkers and then missile turrets.  Get 4 more siege tanks in que, then start
working on goliaths and banshees.  Do this for the first few minutes to build
up a good defensive force.  Go ahead and set up 3 sensor towers as well, one at
each bunker area and one on the artifact platform.

Make sure to keep your troops reinforced for any that fall and this setup will
hold back almost any force sent at you.  Once you have enough goliaths, 
marauders, and banshees, it's time to move to the offensive.  Head to the far
southwest and start chipping away at the zerg.  More than likely you will have
to pull back when the Queen of Blades moves on your base.  Do so, repair, and 
get back to that western hive colony.  Nothing really changes, there is no 
heavy increase in waves.  Only Kerrigan continues to return and occasionally
wreck havok on your defenses.  The few times that she comes at the same time 
as a heavy wave just use the artifact to clear the minions.  This stage is by
far the easiest of the final three.

If you happen to clear the southwest base head to the northeastern base.  Keep
passing time until the artifact is fully charged.  Once it is charged you'll
get a rewarding but VERY short cutscene.  Check your score and enjoy your well
deserved ending.

You'll begin this mission controlling only Zeratul.  Move up the first ramp and
take out the zergling and crawler that await you there.  Move north and a small
note will be made teaching you how to blink with Zeratul.  Blink over and take
out the zerg there.  Continue north until a bridge collapses then blink across
again.  FOllow the path and destroy the obstruction in the road.  Continue
south until you hear a message about spore crawlers.  Stun the crawler, kill 
it, and then take out the zerg nearby.  Head up the ramp and stun the next 
spore crawler and kill it.  Then take out the zerg nearby.  Further north is 
another spore crawler, but this time across a chasm.  You can either stun it 
and then blink or if you are fast enough blink then stun.  Either way both
must be done.  Do it and kill it, then kill any nearby zerg.  Further north
again you'll want to stun a overseer before blinking across to take out the 
4 Hydralisks.  Then step on the beacon at the first shrine.

Follow the path up, around, and down, then blink across a chasm.  A small pause
here while stalkers are brought in to aid you against 3 mutalisks.  Afterwards
all 4 units may blink to the west.  Send the stalkers north hugging the east
side, to take out the overseer, then blink zeratul in to kill the hydralisks.
Continue west on the path.  Have Zeratul take out the spine crawler just 
outside the range of the spore crawlers sight.  Then have him stun the crawler
and kill it.  Then send your stalkers in to take out the 3 patrolling
mutalisks.  If you time it right you can take them out one at a time.  Further
along the path have your stalkers engage the brood lords one at a time.  Let 
your stalkers shields regenerate before moving on.  After blinking past another
chasm you will be assaulted by 2 more mutalisks.  Along the path past the 
mutalisks you'll encounter your first zerg base.  Use your stalkers to take out
the overseers while trying to avoid the spine crawlers.  After the overseers
are dead send zeratul in to clear out the base.  Southwest of the base is the 
second Xel'Naga Shrine.  Along the way you will pick up occasional straglers of
stalkers.  Here there is another.  Step up to the beacon.

Head through the newly opened gate.  Set your stalkers up to kill the overseer
just past the barrier, then send Zeratul in to kill the spine crawlers.  Take
your time afterwards and have your stalkers engage the mutalisks one at a time.
Follow the path south to a ramp, send your stalkers up as fast as you can and
forward to what looks like a dead end.  Let the acid crawlers come to you while
you fire from here.  If it looks as though they will reach you blink to the 
west away from them.  Afterwards move to where the acid crawlers were and you
will see a small patch of land collapse.  Blink across to find the second zerg
hive.  Attack the overseer with your stalkers when it reaches it's southern
most point on it's patrol.  Then send in Zeratul to clear out the hive.  Blink
back to where the acid crawlers were and head north.  Take out the overseer 
here then send in Zeratul.  Move forward and engage the spine crawlers quickly
before they take root.  Then take out the overseer.  Head north and clear a
barrier.  Beyond you'll encounter Karass and a large force of zealots.  They
will aid you in killing the large zerg force.  Let them rush in but play it
safe yourself.  Save your stalkers for the flying units and only send in
Zeratul when there are no detectors.  After the fight move to where Karass is
standing.  To his left you will see a slightly raised plauteu.  Blink your 
troops up there and follow the path south to a chasm.  Blink across it and take
out the obstruction to reveal the path to the third and final Zerg Hatchery.
This one will take some work.  Stun the spine crawler and blink in to kill it.
Quickly blink back out of range of the spore crawlers.  Now move your stalkers
in to aid in finishing the hatchery.  Then blink east and head back towards 
the final beacon.  Before stepping on the beacon make sure all of your troops
are at full shields.  Step on the final beacon for the last shrine.

Now, to run for your life.  Follow the first path counter-clockwise until you
can see the spine crawlers.  As crazy as it sound blink into their area and run
north, then east, then south.  Blink past the first obstruction and then the
second and run for the ship.  Do not stop to kill anything here.  Blink, blink,
blink your way to the end.

Bonus Objectives
.....Power-up Abandoned Structures [3] research


This time around you'll have a Protoss base.  You'll start with a Nexus, 
Gateway, Cybernetics Core, Forge, Twilight Council, and 2 photon cannons.  
You'll also be given 6 probes.  Send 5 to gathering minerals and the 6th to
start placing pylons to activate your structures.  As with the Terrans que up
5 more probes at the Nexus.  After setting up warp points for the 2 pylons
start warping in 2 assimilators on the vespene geysers.  Get 3 Zealots que'd up
at the Gateway.  Once they are out send them scouting nearby to open your map
more.  Once you have enough minerals que up 3 stalkers at your gateway.

Send your zealots to the southwest to the first yellow beacon.  Here you will
find a Robotics Facility.  Bring a probe and warp in a pylon.  Once you control
it you will recieve an Immortal.  Then warp in 2 photon cannons to protect it.
Shortly after Maar, the protoss/zerg Hybrid, will start heading towards your 
base.  With your stalkers, zealots, and cannons at the robotics facility you 
should be able to take him out easily enough.  Move you troops behind the 
cannons and wait for him to get in range.

Afterwards send your troops back to your base and then east to the second
abandoned structure.  Here you will take control of a Dark Shrine.  You will 
gain 2 Dark Templars.  No need to set up cannons at this out of the way 
location.  Send the two dark templars towards the third and final yellow
beacon.  Here have them slowly chip away at the protoss, while building 2-3
more Dark Templars.  Send your new templars to the same location.  Maar will
constantly revive himself and attack you, alternating from west to east and 
back to west.  Cut him off each time near your cannons.  After clearing out
the Protoss base to the far east, send your probe in to claim the Templar
Archive.  Then start building your forces and saving minerals.  Soon we'll
head to the bridge that Maal continues to cross when coming out from his base.

Send your templars just northwest of the bridge and have them clear out the 
stalkers and pylons from the area.  Do not have you templars there when Maal
crosses over.  He will see them and slaughter them.  Slowly work your templars
across the bridge hugging the western edges.  Creep around and take out the
pylons here.  Make sure to train a High Templar.  Their Feedback ability is
extremely useful against Maar.  It drains all of his energy (200) and deals 
1 point of damage per energy drained.  

Once you've taken out the pylons on the west side of the base destory the
gateway.  You'll need to be very careful and perhaps only attack it with one
dark templar, as the cannon can see almost the entire gateway.  Afterwards send
all your Dark Templars to the cannon.  Destroy it and they will be able to
clear everything else out of the west side clearing a path to reach the 
Preservers.  Move in while avoiding Maal and free the Preservers.  Once the
Preservers are free your mission is complete.

Bonus Objectives
.....Power the Obelisks


Zeratul is dropped in alone.  Move north and begin cleansing the area of the 
zerg.  Follow the beach clockwise all the while killing zerg.  You will soon
reach an abandoned Protoss base.  Simply step on the beacon to claim it.  You
will gain a Nexus, Gateway, Forge, Cybernetics Core, Assimilator, and 4 Photon
Cannons.  5 probes will make their way in, put 4 of them to work mining, while
the 5th beings placing pylons to revive your buildings, especially your 
cannons.  Que up 5 more at the nexus then start bringing in the resources.  You
will also gain another Observer and 2 Collosus.  The first attack wave will 
come from the north so be prepared.  Send Zeratul to the east with a probe to
gather minerals and gas shards.  You will see some zerg.  Kill those that you 
can while staying out of sight of any detectors.

Start building your forces, mainly consisting of stalkers.  Send Zeratul to the
northeast of your base and to the first Obelisk.  Send an observer with him to
detect the burrowed zerg forces there.  Clear the area out and then prepare to
power up the obelisk.  Once you power up the Obelisk and the warp gate 
3 stalkers and a high templar will emerge from the gateway.  Build a Nexus on 
this platform and then build 4-5 cannons with pylons naer tha ramp, but not
within site of troops below the ramp.  Once you have 10 stalkers that you can
spare send them all the way east to the now cleared base area with Zeratul.
Begin attacking northwar working towards the southeast Overmind Tentacle.  You
should be able to clear the area with no loses.  Remember to always attack the
overminds first to protect Zeratul.  At the southeast Tentacle there are 2
Ultralisks and an overseer.  Quickly kill the overseer and have your troops 
retreat from the ultralisks, warping to gain distance.  Then have Zeratul move
in with an observer to kill the ultralisks in safety.  Activate the southeast
tentacle and begin moving north.

Move your stalker force north and take out the overseer, then retreat.  You 
don't want to stick around for too long with the acid crawlers attacking your
stalkers.  Send Zeratul in to do the dirty work now that the overseer is dead.
Once you near the next overseer have Zeratul clear what he can of the zerglings
and acid crawlers.  Then stun the Spine crawler, kill it, and retreat.  Next
have your stalkers enter the fray again taking out the zerglings, acid
crawlers, and the overseer.  Do the same with the hatchery close by to the
west.  Move in with zeratul clearing what you can, stun and kill the spike
crawler, and then pull out until your stalkers clear the overseer.  Clear out
the area and claim the second (northeast) tentacle.  Now, plant your 10 
stalkers to the west at the top of the ramp leading up into this area.  Send
Zeratul ALL the way back to your base and then head north with another 10 
stalkers.  You should have 10 more by now don't you?

Have your troops head to the second obelisk, but do not activate it.  Continue
north, with zeratul leading clearing everything until you see an overseer.  You
should be able to clear the entire northern base without any overseers, but if
they come just send in your stalkers to kill it, fall back, and send zeratul
back in.  Once you reach the ramp to the east of this base send in all your
troops including the 10 stalkers holding the ramp east of you.  Clear out the
northern tentacle and claim it.

Now that you've cleared the map of all stationaary troops go and set a pylon
near the second obelisk.  Send Zeratul to the fourth and final tentacle at your
second base, and the mission is complete.

In Mission Objectives
.....Kill 1500 Enemy Forces [research]
.....Defend Until the Last Protoss Falls

Bonus Objectives
.....Protect the Protoss Archive [25min] research

This stage is all about defending.  That's all you do, build and defend.
So, let's make sure we keep alot of cannons near the three main entrances.
Produce serveral zealots and stalkers.  

The first wave will come from the northeast.  The second wave will come from
the northwest, and the third wave from the southeast.  The final wave will have
an ultralisk.  Each wave will send mutalisks of which you should shoot down 
with your  phoenix's.  After 1 wave of attackers come from each of the 3 
entrances to the super-base, there will be an attack from the north by hybrids.

The second full wave will come fiercely.  First from the northwest, then the 
southeast, and finally the north.  Tons more zerglings but other than that
these waves are moderate.  The third wave however will include more hybrids.
Just in time a squad of 5 Void Rays fly in to your aid.  Now the fun begins.
Start pumping out void rays like theres no tomorrow, because for the Protoss
there IS no tomorrow!  Continue making these and exclusively these for some
time.

The third full wave starts with an attack from the northwest which includes a
single hybrid.  The void rays are a powerful tool which you'll soon learn. 
The second from the northeast, the third from the southeast and halfway through
the third a fourth from the northeast will try to sneak in.  Make sure you are
upgrading your air weapons and armors!  You will be making only air troops
from here on out.  No longer worry about replacing cannons either, conserve all
your resources for training starships.

In between the third and fourth Major Waves some Nydus WOrms will burst up near
the archive.  The Void Rays will make instant work of them.  Afterwards five
carriers lead by Zelendis will arrive.  At this point have one stargate 
warping in Void Rays and the second warping in carriers.  Remember to build
interceptors everytime a new carrier comes out or it will be worthless.

The fourth major wave begins with an attack from the northwest, then an attack
from the northeast, followed by a feint to the northeast and a real attack to
the southeast.  Your Air Fleet should now show that it can survive for a long
time to come.

The 5th and 6th wave come nearly back to back.  You'll almost think that the 
waves have stopped and that the troops will come endlessly.  Not so my friend, 
but that time will come soon.  After the 6th wave you'll get a small break.  
This should last until your 25 minute timer is up.  If all went well you should
have nearly 1000 kills.  Only 500 more to go and then you can park your force
and go AFK if you'd like.  That or kill kill kill till everything dies.  My 
first playthrough I died with nearly 2500 kills.

After the break and your 25min limit, there will be a large force building to
the northeast.  Do not engage, instead backtrack into your base and wait for
more Nydus Worms to burst up near your rear sections.  Clean them out then
head northeast.  Send any ground troops you MIGHT have still alive to your
rear base and rely solely on your air fleet to take out the hordes.  The ground
troops in the back will provide you some defense and warning to more worms in 
the future.

If you manage to survive another 2-3 waves you will be granted a Purifier for
your preseverance.  This also means hell is about to break loose.  Add it to 
your fleet and then retreat to your rear base.  SLaughter all that you can
before falling and enjoy the defeat, er, successful mission completion.  Once
you reach 1500 kills there's a small cutscene.  And then the flood truely 
begins.  At this point it's just bragging rights.

Just like the first stage, Jim Raynor dones his Marine armor.  He is dropped in
with 2 medics and 5 marines again.  Head forward to the gate with your troops.
Set and breaching charge with raynor and BACK UP!  Head in and engage a firebat
with his 2 marine friends.  Move forward to the first beacon and activate the 
security camera.  Activate the left set of guns and then move in and take out
the remaining firebats and marines.  Enter Lab 1, take out the holding pen, and
then take out the shackled ultralisk.  Set a breaching charge on the door and 
move out.

Move out of Lab 1, take out the 2-3 marines and grab the grenade ammo.  Head
east and take out the next squad of marines, firebats, and medics.  At the top
of the ramp lob a grenade at the marauder and then access the second security
station.  I chose to release the Ultralisks which completely wiped out the 
forces and left one half dead ultralisk.  Move in and finish it off.  Destroy
the holding pen and grab the protoss relic it hid.  Exit the lab and blow 
open the door to the northeast to grab some plasma shots.

Move southwest through the gate and lob a grenade at the grounded viking.  Then
be ready to throw another at a siege tank.  Access the security terminal 
after grabbing the plasma shots nearby.  You have three options to arm the bot.
Arm the bot with anti armor and move in with all your troops.  Have the bot 
target the 2 siege tanks and 2 vikings.  Then clean up the left over marines.
Grab the additional grenade ammo in the back of this room and head northwest.
Have a plasma shot ready for the siege tank waiting beyond and another for the
viking in the room.  Access the 4th security terminal.  Request the troops of
your choice, though if you have no medics I suggest you get some.  Blast the
door to the northeast and head in Throwing plasma and grenades all over.  After
clearing the room head to the southeast side grabing the grenades, resto, and
the second protoss relic.  Grab more Plasma ammo and activate the security
terminal.  Release the Brutalisk if you dare and fill it with plasma shots.
Then set a charge and blow the northeastern door.  Exit Lab 3 and enter the 
fusion lab.  Kill the 2 pairs of marines in the room and then destroy Fusion 
Reactor.

Once you release the destruction, head northwest and grab the plasma shots
before moving out of the reactor room.  Head southwest, clearing troops along
the way, and grab the Chrono Rift Armor.  Then south and destroy the debris and
move on.  Here the Destruction breaks through.  Quickly slow it with the 
Chrono armor and run southwest.  Activate the security console so that a bot
will help slow things.  Move southeast and lob a grenade at a marine guarded
debris pile to grab more chrono armor and then move south for a resto.

Quickly grab the protoss relic in the next room while avoided the experiments.
Move southeast and continue to run from the destruction.  Grab the 4th protoss
relic and keep running, throwing grenades at debris to clear them as needed.
Once you reach the zerg infested room you'll be safe for a moment.  Clear the 
area slowly and then kill the ultralisk as you are leaving.  Grab the next 
Chrono armor and keep running.  Throw a single grenade at the fighting zerg
and marines and run through the blast.  Head straight for the beacon and get
off this rock!  Mission complete.

Chapter V - Armory [05.Armo]

*******************************************************************************

In the Hyperions Armory you will find a Tech Upgrade console.  Here you can 
fine tune your Units and Buildings with custom upgrades.  Each unit and 
building has two upgrades available and you can purchase both.  They have a 
cost in credits associated, but once purchased they are forever a part of your
units and buildings.  Below is a list of upgrades available to you as the game
progresses.  All but the Base upgrades become available as soon as you complete
the mission that unlocks that Unit for you.



********************
A. Base
********************



.....Bunker

Projectile Accelerator: This upgrade benefits the troops that are housed inside
granting them +1 range to their attacks.

Cost: 40,000

Neosteel Bunker: This increases the space inside a bunker allowing 2 more slots
worth of troops to be garrisoned inside.

Cost: 50,000

.....Missile Turret

Titanium Housing: +75 Life to your missle turrets should help them survive 
longer.

Cost: 50,000

Hellstorm Batteries: This upgrade gives a nice damage boost to your missle 
turrets.  Adding a second attack doubles their damage output, but the second
attack also does area of effect damage!

Cost: 80,000

.....SCV

Advanced Construction: This upgrade gives your SCVs the hivemind mentality.  
They can now work together to build structures faster.  Each additional SCV 
that you have building a structure decreases the total amount of time to

ground.

Cost: 90,000

Orbital Command: This upgrade adds the classic scanner sweep ability to the 
Command Center.  This ability temporarily removes the fog of war from the map
in a select location.  It also gives the command center the ability to have
MULEs dropped in from orbit.  These are sooped up SCVs in that they can gather
much faster and produce a surge in mineral production.  Unfortunately, they are
only temporary and burn themselves out after a limited amount of time.

Cost: 125,000



********************
B. Infantry
********************



.....Marine

Stimpacks: Just like the original starcraft your marines can be stim junkies.
This upgrade grants marines an ability that when used gives them a 50% increase
to firing speed and movement speed for 15 seconds at a cost of 10 Life.  This
life can be healed by medics.

Cost: 50,000

Combat Shield: A nice basic +10 Life to your marines.

and it's damage against light targets (+3).

Cost: 60,000

G-4 Clusterbomb: This clusterbomb is an anti-personal weapon that deals an 
initial damage to the main target and then a lesser damage in an area of effect
to targets in the blast radius.

Cost: 75,000



********************
C. Vehicles
********************



.....Hellion

Twin-Linked Flamethrower: A Hellions Flame attacks has its width doubled with
this upgrade

Cost: 40,000

Thermite Filaments: This upgrade boost the Hellions damage vs light targets by

Replenishable Magazine: Vultures can restock their mines while in the field
with this upgrade.  Each mine costs 15 minerals to restock.

Cost: 60,000


.....Goliath

Multi-Lock Weapons System: This can double the effectiveness of your Goliaths,
allowing them to fire both of their weapons at the same time, thus attacking
ground and air based units simultaneously.

Cost: 50,000

Ares-Class Targeting System: This targeting system adds effective range to both
the Goliaths missiles (+3 range) and cannons (+1 range).

Cost: 80,000

destroyed, so make sure to bring some troops to defend it once it is back on 
its feet.

Cost:140,000



*******************************************************************************

Chapter VI - Laboratory [06.Labo]

*******************************************************************************




Another new feature adding even more depth to Starcraft 2 is the research 
section found in the laboratory.  As you progress through the story mode of 
Starcraft 2, you are awarded research points for completing secondary 
(and sometimes Primary) objectives within most missions.  These are split into 
two groups.  Protoss research points and Zerg research points.  These two 
seperate pools allow you to specialize your gameplay.  There are five tiers of 
research for each, giving a total of ten researches.  Each tier offers you a 
choice between two upgrades.  Please note that you can only choose one upgrade 
to research per tier and once you have chosen you cannot undo that research 
option.  All of my suggested upgrade choices take the long term into account.
The Walkthrough will also assume you took these suggested choices.  It will 
also give you a time when the research option becomes available if you follow
the walkthrough's path of missions.


********************
A. Protoss Research
********************


**********Tier I (Research Level 5)**********

.....Ultra-Capacitors

By researching Ultra-Capacitors, you give added attack speed to all of your
units everytime you upgrade their weapons.  This bonus is applied to all 
upgrades at the Engineering bay or Armory.  5% increased attack speed per 
weapons upgrade to a maximum of +15% attack speed.

.....Vanadium Plating

Counter to the Ultra-Capacitors is Vanadium Plating, it gives added Life to all
of your units everytime you upgrade their armor.  This bonus is applied to all 
upgrades at the Engineering bay or Armory.  5% increased Life per armor 
upgrade to a maximum of +15% Life.

.....Suggested Tier I Protoss Research: Vanadium Plating

This suggestion is more for a mid to late game advantage.  A level 3 weapon 
upgrade would give you units a 15% increase to attack speed where the 
Vanadium Plating gives them a 15% increase to Life.  I feel this is much more
valuable when looking at larger units like your Battlecruisers.  Hundreds more
life compared to a moderate attack speed boots.


**********Tier II (Research Level 10)**********

.....Orbital Depots

Orbital Depots allow your Supply Depots to be dropped directly from orbit 
instead of being constructed by your SCVs.  Simply set a landing site and move
on to the next project.

.....Micro-Filtering

Micro-Filtering makes you refineries produces Vespene gas faster, 25% faster
to be exact.  Who doesn't want more Vespene Gas?

.....Suggested Tier II Protoss Research: Micro-Filtering

I never had too much trouble with the speed at which my supply depots were 
built.  If you tend to get bogged down going back and forth slowly building
your supply depots than you may wish to change to Orbital Depots.  I also chose
the Automated Refinery for Tier III and this could impact your choice.


**********Tier III (Research Level 15)**********

.....Automated Refinery

No longer must you commit one of three or any number of SCV's to harvesting
Vespene Gas.  The Automated Refinery is exactly that, self automated.  This
means you build it and leave it.  

.....Command Center Reactor

Similar to the Reactor of your Barracks, Armory, and Starport.  The Command 
Center Reactor allows you to build two SCVs at the same time.

.....Suggested Tier III Protoss Research: Automated Refinery

The main reason you would want a Command Center Reactor is if you are starting
with no SCVs.  Most missions start you with only a few less SCVs than you would
need.  Making the refineries automated means you'll need even less SCVs.  
Couple this with Micro-Filtering and you will rarely be short on Vespene gas.


**********Tier IV (Research Level 20)**********

.....Raven

The Raven is one of two Starships that become available with the Tier IV 
Protoss research.  It can see cloaked and burrowed enemies.  It has three 
offensive abilities.  The first is it's direct damage Seeker missles.  
Secondly, it can drop Auto-Turrets.  And finally it can deploy Point Defense 
Drones.

.....Science Vessel

Like the Raven, the Science Vessal can also detect cloaked and burrowed 
enemies.  Like your SCVs, the Science vessal can repair mechanical units.  It
also has it's classic attack of irradiating enemy units.

.....Suggested Tier IV Protoss Research: Raven

This one is kinda a personal prefernce.  I found no overt advantage between the
two.  I personally chose the Raven as it is more offensive.  Although the 
repair feature of the Science Vessal sounds nice your SCV's can do the same 
job.


**********Tier V (Research Level 25)**********

.....Tech Reactor

The Tech Reactor takes away the need to decide between a Tech Lab, a Reactor, 
or building two structures to have one of each.  It effectively combines the 
two into one single add-on for your Barracks, Factories, and Starports.

.....Orbital Strike

The Orbital Strike research option allows your troops to be dropped in from 
space directly to the front lines.  When your troops are completed at the 
Barracks, they are instantly dropped in to the Barracks Rally Point.

.....Suggested Tier V Protoss Research: Tech Reactor

This one was a no brainer for me.  By the time you accumulate the twenty-five
Protoss Research points to choose your final research you shouldn't be using
many ground based troops.  Thus being able to build two-at-once for both your
Factory and Starport of the advanced vehicles and starships is a much better 
option.


********************
B. Zerg Research
********************


**********Tier I (Research Level 5)********** 

.....Shrike Turret

The Shrike Turret gives all your bunkers an automated turret.  It does not 
require anyone to be in the bunker to fire.  But I guess automated kinda gives
that away, eh?

.....Fortified Bunker
As the name implies, Fortified Bunkers are hardier than their non-fortified
brothers.  This gives all bunkers +150 Life.

.....Suggested Tier I Zerg Research: Shrike Turret

More often than not the bunkers that are taking heavy damage will have an SCV
assigned to them.  Also, if a bunker is taking damage it obviously needs more
firepower to kill your enemies before they get in range to damage the bunker.


**********Tier II (Research Level 10)**********

.....Planetary Fortress

This research option gives your Command Center an automated cannon.  It also 
upgrades the armor of your Command Center.  Unfortunately your CC is now too
heavy to lift off and cannot be moved.

.....Perdition Turret

Similar to the missle turrets, the Perdition is an automated offensive turret.
Unlike the missle turret it targets ground units.  Useful for massive swarms.
Also to be noted the Perdition Turret hides unground when not in use.

.....Suggested Tier II Zerg Research: Perdition Turret

Similar to the Tier IV Protoss research, this one is a matter of personal 
choice.  I chose the Perdition Turret, but rarely used it.  Although my 
Command Centers never came under direct attack, ever.  So the Planetary 
Fortress would not have done me much better, especially since they can no 
longer lift off.


**********Tier III (Research Level 15)**********

.....Predator

Like the Tier IV Protoss research, the Tier III Zerg research gives you a 
choice of two new units.  The Predator is an anti-infantry troop.  Everytime
the predator attacks an enemy it puts off an electrical discharge that damages
all nearby troops.  Great for Zerg Swarms, not much else.

.....Hercules

The Hercules is the only transport you will ever need.  Unless you prefer the 
healing factor of the Medivacs.  It can hold a much larger amount of troops. 
Send one of these into the field and you can take your entire army with it!

.....Suggested Tier III Zerg Research: Hercules

I never had much problems with zerg swarms.  My bunkers tended to clean them up
easily.  So, when it comes time to play the troop transport game a single ship
that could take much more of a beating than the medivac was an easy choice.
This one is a personal preference, though, and either will work fine.


**********Tier IV (Research Level 20)**********

.....Cellular Reactor

This reactor gives a boost to your specialty units.  It gives them +100 
starting energy as well as +100 max energy.  This is all energy using Units, 
including your starships.

.....Regenerative Bio-Steel

Ah Regenerative Bio-Steel.  What's that you say?  I no longer need an army of 
SCVs following my tanks, battlecruisers, and other mechanized troops?  Ah, true
love at last!

.....Suggested Tier IV Zerg Research: Regenerative Bio-Steel

I rarely used the special abilities of the specialist units.  When I did it was
not in rapid succession so the added energy boost was of little use to me.  The
Regenerative Bio-Steel on the otherhand came in quite handy.  


**********Tier V (Research Level 25)**********

.....Hive Mind Emulator

The Tier V Zerg research gives you the choice of two anti-zerg structures.  The
Hive Mind Emulator is a fun little structure that allows you to permanently 
mind control a zerg target!  It takes energy to use and that energy does refill
over time like all of your units energy.  Great for the proactive player that
doesn't mind sitting and waiting for the zerg to enter range.

.....Psi Disrupter

The Psi Disrupter puts out a constant slowing effect around it that affects all
Zerg that enters it's field by 50%.  Pair these up with your bunkers for 
maxiumum effect.

.....Suggested Tier V Zerg Research: Psi Disrupter

As fun as it was to mind control zerg, the overall effect of the Psi Disrupter
when paired up with bunkers was just much more effective than waiting to pick
off the one zerg that would enter range before it died.  I loved the Hive Mind 
Emulator, but the Disrupter just wins by sheer effectiveness.



*******************************************************************************

Chapter VII - Mercenaries [07.Merc]

*******************************************************************************

As you progress through the storyline various mercenary units become available.
These are elite versions of most of the unit types.  They each have a "Hire"
cost that once paid makes them permanently available in following campaign 
missions.  You hire mercenaries in the Hyperion Cantina.  Unlike producing 
units, mercenaries are orbitally dropped into the battle once you pay their 
merc fee at the Merc Compound.  


********************
A. War Pigs
********************

Elite Marines, the War Pigs come in groups of four, and you are limited to 3 
squads per mission.  They have +65% Life and +35% damage compared to standard
marines.  They have a recruit cooldown of 5 minutes.
