------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You played the multiplayer mode.
At some times you get overwhelmed by a mass of the same units.
Or you get totally destroyed by a certain unit which you think is overpowered.
You panic, not knowing what to do and sometimes even go so far to rage quit.
Fear not as this guide will list all units in multiplayer and the strategies,
to completely destroy a certain unit you have trouble with.

Note that I don't include buildings since they are... well buildings.
Of course that is unless the building has a weapon like the photon cannon.
But even so, I only list them to as a counter strategy.
And also I won't include Single Player only units since if you ever get to use
that particular unit, the game will include enough tutorial about that unit.
And lastly, I don't even bother with attack upgrades.
It gives attack upgrades, big deal but everyone knows how it works right?

The statistic I put with the unit will look like this:

====
Name
====
Supply cost: The amount of supply this unit uses.
Prerequisite: Requirements (excluding the building used to train.)
Train from: Buildings used to train this unit.
Type: The type of the unit.
HP: The hp the unit has.
Weapon name and damage: The name of the weapon and the damage it causes.
Bonus Damage: Extra damage on a certain type of unit.
Range: Range of the weapon.
Target: What kind of target it can hit.
Fire Speed: The speed depends how fast an unit attacks. Lower = faster
Move Speed: The moving speed. Higher = faster
Armor: The armor of the unit.
Cost: The unit cost.
Build Speed: The time it requires to build the unit in ingame seconds.
Special Abilities: The Special abilities this unit has access to.
Upgrades: Shows what kind of upgrades affect this unit.
Counter as zerg: Which unit counters this unit as zerg.
Counter as Terran: Which unit counters this unit as terran.
Counter as Protoss: Which unit counter this unit as protoss.

Of course you don't have to read the whole guide. Just press Ctrl + F and type
the name of your unit you want to search.
And if you see things like this: (110) then it means it takes
110 seconds to research. If it has no numbers behind, then it means you don't
have to research for it.

Also, there are 4 things that may appear at skills section at units.
(Passive) = Is automatically activated
(Channeled) = The unit is immobile while using this skill.
(Auto) = This skill can be set to auto use by right clicking.
(Sacrifice) = Units are sacrificed and/or morphed into different units.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Latest Update
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Didn't feel like keeping all this logs, so i'm bringing up the latest update.
Also, I will refer the update numbers to the current patch from now on.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Terran
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terran are the humans in the late 2500 or so with space equipment and gear.
They are extremely versatile, enabling to counter anything if played properly.
The cost isn't as high as the protoss but it isn't lower then the zerg.
The terrans use supply depots to increase their supplies.
Somehow, protoss players (and me) argues about Terran being overpowered.

For Ctrl + F option, type t[unit name]
For example if you want to search for a Marine, type [tMarine]

Move speed: 2.25 + 1.12 (Stimpack)

                   Research at Tech Lab. 100 minerals 100 gas. (170)

Upgrades: Combat Shield: All marines gets 10+ max HP. (110) 
          Upgrade at Tech Lab.
Counter as Zerg:
1. Ultralisk: You have a dumb opponent that never attacks, but only masses
   marines? The ultralisk will teach them a lesson.

2. Roach: Defeats marines with ease.

3. Hydralisk: Also defeats marines with ease, but has lower health then roach.

4. Baneling: Instantly kills a marine with a kamikaze.
   The problem is, most of the time, they are killed before they
   reach their target. If you notice your opponent doesn't have any detectors
   you can always burrow and pop up right under them dealing alot of damage.

Counter as Terran:
1. Siege tank: Siege tank in siege mode does 35 damage + splash.
   1 shot will nearly kill several marines who likes to clump together.
   And another fact is, the tank outrange the marine.

2. Hellions: The anti infantry mech of terran. Abuse them against peoples
   who only masses basic infantry.
   With 24 damage after the upgrade, you 2 hit them.
   It also affects the whole row since its fire so you can kill multiple
   marines with this too.

3. Reaper: Also kills all Light Armored units. Unit is too expensive and
   underpowered later though.

4. Ghost: For just 25 energy, you instantly kill a marine with a snipe.

Counter as Protoss:
1. Colossus: Colossus owns most of the ground units in the game.
   With upgraded Laser, you can even kite those marines around.

2. High Templar: Storm them and you can relax while you watch them die.

3. Dark Templar: They 1 hit those marines and are cloaked, so why not?

4. Archon: Deals 35 to marines + splash so why not?
   Don't get EMP'ed though.

5. Zealot: Somehow effective against Marines.

6. Sentry: Helps to lessen damage, don't use them alone though.


======
Reaper                                                          [tReaper]

          Factory required.

Counter as zerg: 
1. Roach: Destroys them pretty quickly while they do a crappy 8 damage.

2. Baneling: With alot of banelings, you can make short work of them
   if you chase them down.

3. Zergling: With speed upgraded, you can actually chase them down and
   overwhelm them since you always get more zerglings and
   its faster to produce.

4. Brood Lord: Eliminates a reaper immediately with his 2 shots.
   Brood Lords are late game and not many people use reapers this late.
   #4 for this reason.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Siege tank: A sieged tank will nearly kill any reapers.

2. Marauder: Marauders are armored so they suffer no damage bonus from reapers.
   Marauders has alot of hp too.

3. Viking: They can defeat those reapers with ease actually in Assault Mode.

4. Banshee: 24 damage + they fly so I think you know why.
   Late game though.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Colossus: Owns them in 2 hits, nuff said.

2. Stalker: Good for pesky early rushes.

3. Photon cannon: 2 well placed cannons can protect you from reaper rush.



========

                   Research at Tech Lab. 100 minerals 100 gas. (170)
Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Zergling: Since none of the Marauder's damage bonuses applies on zerglings,
             Alot of zerglings can overwhelm them.

2. Mutalisk: Free hits :)

3. Hydralisk: Again with a big group, they can overwhelm marauders.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Marine: Mass marine always beats mass marauders.

2. Banshee: Flying around while getting free kills on those helpless marauders

3. Marauders: Make more then your opponent does and upgrade them.
   Thats another option.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Immortal: They 3 shots those marauders while they do 10 damage on immortals
   Immortals rate of fire is also faster.

2. Void Ray: Again like all other air units, free kills.

3. High Templar: A storm will weaken the marauders by alot,
   abuse storm against terran MMM noobs.

4. Dark Templar: They do 45 + cloak so its perfect against marauders.
   Well... unless they have detectors.

5. Zealot: Zealots works fine against Marauders too.

                   Nuclear Strike: Point a location for a nuke to hit.
                   The ghost pointing the target won't be able to move and if
                   the ghost dies or cancels while the nuke launched, the nuke
                   will be wasted. The nuke will land after 20 seconds.

Counter as zerg: 
1. Overseer: It detects, nuff said.

2. Roach: It owns all infantries except armored
   and of course you should get roaches.

3. Zergling: Overwhelm the ghost with zerglings and he will die.

4. Drones: If the ghost tries to nuke you while he either is
   detected or not cloaked, charge him with all your workers and he will die.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Raven: It detects, nuff said.

2. Siege Tank: Supported with detection, it destroys the ghost in 3 shots.

3. Ghost: The first one to fire the EMP round wins.
          After that, just cloak and shoot or spam snipe.

4. SCV: Same strategy as the Drones.


Counter as Protoss: 
1. Photon Cannon: It detects and it CAN kill the ghost! Its like 2 in 1.

2. Observer: It detects, nuff said

3. Stalker: Ghosts do minimal damage to armored, so the Stalker works.

4. Colossus: Kills a ghost in 3 attacks

5. Probes: Same strategy as the Drones.

Hellion                                                         [tHellion]

          Upgrade at Tech Lab. 150 minerals 150 gas. (110)

Counter as zerg: 
1. Roach: Roaches can defeat multiple Hellions easily.

2. Spine Crawler: Hellions won't do much damage at all on buildings.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Thor: Destroys a Hellion with 2 attacks, and you need ALOT of
   hellions to take out a Thor.

2. Siege Tank: Destroys Hellions easily too, in both modes.

3. Marauders: They are armored, so Hellions won't do bonus damage on them.

4. Reapers: Reapers may be Light, but Hellions are also Light!
   They will do bonus damage on each other, but the reapers will win.


Counter as Protoss: 
1. Stalker: Easy way to get rid of them in the beginning.

2. Colossus: Excellent against Hellions but not many people use
   Hellions late game, especially against protoss.

3. Dark Templar: A good strategy if your opponent doesn't have any detectors
   otherwise, don't bother with it.

==========
Siege Tank                                                      [tSiege Tank]

                   Research at Tech Lab. 100 minerals 100 gas. (80)
Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Mutalisk: They hit tanks pretty easy and they can't be hit by the tank.

2. Brood Lords: Even better then the mutalisk.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Banshee: The safest way to dominate Siege Tanks.

2. Thor: With Thor, you can just tank all the damage and destroy them.

3. Viking: Just switch to Assault mode near them while they are sieged
   and you get free shots while he wastes his time unsieging.

4. Battlecruiser: Destroys the tanks in seconds, but its incredible tech heavy

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Immortal: With the Shield, the tanks only do 10 damage on them while
   the immortal does 50 DAMAGE on the tanks.

2. Void ray: Safe way to dominate Tanks.

3. Phoenix: You can Graviton the tanks and take them down with a group.

4. Dark Templar: Another strategy if the opponent does't have any detectors.
   If they do have detectors, the tanks are untouchable by Dark Templars.

5. Carrier: Destroys those tanks in seconds, but tech heavy.

 Thor                                                           [tThor]

                   Research at tech lab. 150 minerals 150 gas. (110)
Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Zergling: A cheap solution. The thor does overkill anyway so he
   will waste his time shooting at them.

2. Brood Lord: Brood Lords works too with alot of them.

3. Infestor: Neural Parasite the Thor and you may have a chance to use it.
   The infestor is extremely vulnerable so don't expect this to always work.


Counter as Terran: 
1. Battlecruiser: Somehow defeats multiple thors ALONE without even using
   the Yamato Cannon. Its effective.

2. Banshee: Cloaked Banshees makes short work of Thors. (Risky)

3. Marines: A cheap solution. The thor does overkill to marines so he will
   be wasting time shooting at marines while they are blasting him to bits.

4. Marauder: Thors doesnt win if you gang on them with Marauders.

5. Thor: The 250MM cannon instantly destroys the Thor.
   First one to use that skill wins and leaves with full hp and a kill.

6. Siege Tank: If all else fails, let your siege tanks hammer the Thor until
   it dies before it reaches you.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Immortal: They take 10 damage with their Shields while they do 50 DAMAGE.
   They can't win alone though as Thors fires 2 times.

2. Colossus: With range upgraded, you can even kite those Thors around.
   With a mass, you can even own those thors.

3. Void ray: With such a pathetic anti-air attack, you can defeat them easily.

4. Zealot: Mass Zealot solves the problem. Thor has to hit 3 times to
   defeat a zealot and with so many of them, he will go down quick.

5. Dark Templar: A free kill if theres no detection.

Counter as zerg:
1. Ultralisk: If they dare to come to grounds, the ultralisk

3. Hydralisk: Shoot them while they are airborne and get another couple of
   free hits while hes wasting time switching modes or fleeing.

4. Spore Cannon: Anti air, nuff said.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: Make more viking than he does and upgrade them.

2. Thor: Or choose the ground approach where the vikings are forced
   to fight on ground. The Thor is perfect for that strategy.
   It has anti air missiles and if the viking dares to come to ground, the
   thor will obliberate him.

3. Siege Tank: Siege Tank dominates vikings if they ever dare
   to approach on ground. Make sure your not sieged though.

4. Missile Turret: Anti air, nuff said.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Stalker: Stalkers dominates vikings because of their bonus vs Armored.
   Also, the stalker can shoot both ground and air.

2. Immortal: Immortals make short work of vikings on ground.

3. Zealot: If they dare to come to ground, the zealots will tear them apart. 

4. Void Ray: They are weak against vikings, but if you charge up the laser
   you dominate the vikings instead!

1. Corruptor: Corruptors will defeat Banshees easily.

3. Mutalisk: A nice alternative for Corruptors.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: Destroys Banshees easily, but they cannot chase them :(

2. Marines: Mass marines will easily defeat a mass banshees.

3. Thor: Their anti air missiles are pretty effective against them.

4. Battlecruiser: Totally obliberates Banshees. Too bad they are so slow.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Phoenix: Chase them down with those Phoenix for some free kills.

2. Observer: Detection for the pesky cloak.

3. Void Ray: A nice alternative for Phoenix, but slower.

3. Marine: You need the ability to shoot air and marines offer you that.
   Watch out for Seeker Missiles.

4. Battlecruiser: Actually effective if your opponent
   uses a Point Defense Drone since the battlecruisers attacks 6 times a round

Counter as zerg: 
1. Corruptor: Extra damage on Massive types and they can corrupt
   the battlecruiser, dealing extra damage.
   However you need alot of them, so don't expect 1 corruptor to defeat a
   battlecruiser.

2. Infestor: Neural Parasite the battlecruiser and attack your enemy with it.
   The infestor will be extremely vulnerable so don't expect this
   to always work.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: The king of anti air, with 3 even possible to defeat a
   battlecruiser, barely. You can also abuse the speed of the Battlecruiser
   and kite it with vikings.

2. Marine: With alot of marines, like 15 you can defeat
   a battlecruiser with them.
   Don't expect that to happen in late game where your opponent has alot of
   Battlecruisers.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Void Ray: The only truly effective weapon against the battlecruiser.
   But you need alot of them to defeat multiple battlecruisers.

2. Carrier: Well, its better then nothing, but compared to void ray,
   the void ray is better.

3. Sentry: Somehow helpful by lessening the damage, but dont expect them
   to always survive...

5. Protoss
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protoss have the strongest unit of the 3 races.
But of course at the same time, they have the most expensive units and the
build time of them is the longest.
All protoss units also has a plasma shield that recharges on its own after
some time not in battle.
Also instead of being able to build freely like terran, they must build
in fields powered by a pylon. Supply also increases by pylons.
If you compare them with the movie Alien Vs Predator, they are most likely
the Predator.

For Ctrl + F option, type p[unit name]
For example if you want to search for a zealot, type [pZealot]

2. Mutalisk: Free hits on those helpless zealots.

3. Ultralisk: A nice alternative if you decide to take them on ground.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Wall: Just wall off your base with supply depots and barracks.
   Zerg and Protoss rushes won't work as long as there are marines behind it.

2. Hellion: They do bonus damage on Light units and Zealot = Light.
   And since the Hellion is ranged and moves much much faster,
   it can kite the zealots around. (unless charge is researched)

3. Reaper: Reapers owns Zealots as long as you kite. If they get too close
   your screwed. Kiting is unavaible if they researched Charge.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Colossus: Colossus owns all 3 basic infantries and zealots are 1 of them.
   Don't let them swarm the colossus though :P

2. Sentry: Force Field the ramp of your base and they won't be able
   to get through. Sentries and stalkers can shoot them.

3. Zealot: You can also make more zealots then he has and upgrade them.

4. Stalker: You can kite the zealots around, but the zealots will
   eventually catch up. Even worse when they researched Charge.

1. Zergling: Zergling always beat stalkers on ground.

2. Hydralisk: Also works if you have alot of them since they have higher
   rate of fire and takes no bonus damage from Stalkers.

3. Brood Lords: Incredible effective since they are long range.
   Unless they massed air units, this is the perfect anti ground unit.


Counter as Terran: 
1. Marine: Mass marines always beats mass stalker.
   They fire 2x faster then a stalker so they do 12 damage while
   they do a measly 10 damage.

2. Marauder: Stalker is expensive but somehow gets owned by marauders alone
   even when they are cheaper and fast to produce.

3. Siege Tank: Better firepower and HP = Victory

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Immortal: With his 50 damage a shot and faster fire rate, they
   destroy those stalkers with ease.

2. Zealot: Research Charge with it and you will catch up with stalkers and
   make short work of them.

3. Stalker: Another option is to make more stalkers then he does and upgrade.

2. Mutalisk: Easy and a kinda safe way to pick them off.
   Avoid the storm at all cost since Mutalisks likes to clump together.

3. Brood lord: Tech heavy, but works good.

Counter as Terran:

   prevent him from attacking you. Brood Lord works with his long range.

2. Ultralisk: Barely takes out an archon on his own.

3. Hydralisk: Since archons can tank alot of hits, you should charge them
   down with Brute Force. Hydralisk does enough damage for that.

Counter as Terran:
1. Ghost: EMP it like 3 or 4 times and even a marine
   can take it out on his own.

2. Thor: 250 MM cannon will do it.

3. Siege Tank: Siege tanks in siege mode will defeat it too
   if you don't have a Thor.

   decides to drop in your base with transports.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Void Ray: Best in chasing since they can fire and move at the same time.

2. Phoenix: Nice alternative.

3. Photon Cannon: Solves the problem of enemy dropping in through transport.

1. Hydralisk: Low hp prevents them from charging the beam while it
   does good damage on the Void ray.

2. Corruptor: Works pretty good, but make sure you have more corruptors

Counter as Terran: 
1. Marine: Mass marines will defeat those Void Rays while with their
   low hp, they can't charge their beams.

   have alot of corruptors and destroys those interceptors first.

2. Hydralisk: They do even better in destroying those Interceptors, but
   most of the time, the carrier is out of reach.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: Great against the carrier with its 28 damage a shot.

2. Marines: If all else fails, you should use marines, which
   is better then nothing.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Stalker: Mass stalkers defeats carriers as long as you shoot
   at the interceptors first.

2. Void Ray: With his high hp, Void Rays can charge up the laser easily.

Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Corruptor: With their 20 damage against massive they are
   effective against the mothership.

2. Hydralisk: Works too with big mass.

3. Mutalisk: Also effective but I recommend you to avoid using mutalisk
   because of its high gas cost.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: The king of anti air will take down the mothership easily
   with its high damage output and it outranges the mothership.

2. Battlecruiser: Fire some yamato cannon rounds on it and it will be
   destroyed pretty soon.

3. Marine: Mass marines is somehow effective against the mothership.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Void Ray: It works, but make sure you have plenty of them.

2. Stalker: Extra damage against armored so why not?

3. Carrier: If its late game, use the carriers and destroy it.
   Pretty effective too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Zerg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zerg is an interesting race because unlike the other two races where you have
to build a barrack or something, the units are instead created by a larva.
And unlike other workers, the worker self becomes the building.
It means that all units of zerg are biological, even structures.
The buildings must be placed on creep, a purple biomass thats on the ground.
All zerg units and structures regenerates on its own over time.
Also the supply increases only when you build overlords.
And yes, the overlord is an unit.
Compared to the movie Alien vs Predator, the zerg are likely the Alien.

Note: Almost all zerg units moves faster on creep. Take advantage of this.

Another Note: Note that ALL zerg units can also burrow. Yes, I'm lazy so
I'm not going to include this. Exception is if the unit has an
unique ability underground like the Roach.

For Ctrl + F option, type z[unit name]
For example if you want to search the Zergling, type [zZergling]

                   Spawn Larva: Target a Hatchery, Lair or Hive and

Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Roach: No matter what, roach will always defeat the queen. :P

2. Hydralisk: It works as the roach, but dies faster.

3. Zergling: Some zerglings will defeat a queen while its wasting time
   slashing at the zerglings.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Reaper: With their extra damage against them, its effective.

2. Ghost: Snipe already does 45 damage + 10 so its a quick kill
   as long as you snipe.

3. Marauder: With their armor, the queen will waste her time doing 6 damage
   while the marauders does 10 damage a shot.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Archon: They kill it very quickly since it owns all biological units.
   Another good news is, the archon can't be kited by the queen.

2. High Templar: You rarely see a queen with 175 energy, but if you do
   see 1, feedback it for a quick kill and some lulz.

3. Dark Templar: The good thing about the dark templar is that they do alot
   of damage already on his own and is permanently cloaked.
   Of course this strategy shouldn't be used if your opponent has detection.


Note: No one ever is dumb enough to mass queens, but the strategy is here
      so you can see whats effective against them.

          Adrenal Glands: Increase the attack speed of zerglings by 20%.
          Evolve at Spawning Pool. 200 minerals 200 gas. (140)

          
Counter as zerg: 
1. Baneling: It does 35 damage + splash so 1 baneling is enough to
   kill several zerglings. Another good news is that if the zerglings dares
   to kill the baneling, they die.

2. Roach: Good alternative and it lasts longer then the baneling.

3. Ultralisk: Kills multiple zerglings in 3 hits.
   Of course its tech heavy so it got a #3.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Wall: Just wall of your base and you will be fine as long as
   there are marines shooting those zerglings.

2. Hellion: With their insane AoE attack, they can kill multiple zerglings
   in 2 or 3 attacks since they like to clump together.

3. Siege Tank: Kills multiple zerglings in 1 shot
   but don't let them get close though.

4. Reaper: 2 attacks from a reaper will kill a zergling and you can kite
   them around as long as they don't evolve Metabolic Boost.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Colossus: They kill zerglings efficiently, but don't expect a colossus
   to defeat mass zerglings alone, have some units to back them up.

2. Archon: They do exactly 35 damage and its splash, so they
   kill multiple zerglings with 1 attack.

3. High Templar: 1 Storm kills lots of zerglins, well unless you screw up.

4. Zealot: Its like zealots were made to tank and kill zerglings in starcraft.
   Merely 1 zealot can take on 4 zerglings. With 1 attack upgrade, you defeat
   a zergling in just 2 attacks.

Upgrades: Centrifugal Hooks: Increase the speed of Banelings.
          Evolve at Baneling Nest. 150 minerals 150 gas. (110)

Counter as zerg: 
1. Roach: Since roaches are not Light, banelings will only do 20 damage.
   And of course, roaches are ranged, so they can take them out from afar.

2. Mutalisk: By air, you can pick them off while they can't harm you.

3. Hydralisk: Much riskier since its Light, but has bigger range.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Siege Tank: 1 shot from the Siege Tank in siege mode will destroy multiple
   banelings and since its not Light, it won't take full damage.

2. Hellion: With its long AoE attack and high speed, you can kite them.

3. Marauder: With Concussive Shell, they can kite banelings around with proper
   micro and because its armored too, it won't take full damage.


Counter as Protoss: 
1. Archon: Its like archons are made to tank Banelings. Archons kill multiple
   banelings in 1 hit while you need ALOT of banelings just to kill an archon.

2. High Templar: Just like zerglings, 1 storm will kill many of them.
   BUT, dont let them get close.

3. Immortals: They tank those banelings good since they only take 10 damage
   and if the shields are gone, 20 damage.

4. Colossus: Another good alternative for tanking.


Note: Another great tactic is to sacrifice 1 unit to destroy multiple
      banelings. The trade off is very good since your main attack force
      will be unharmed.

Counter as zerg: 
1. Mutalisk: Free hits on those helpless roaches.

2. Overseer: The last thing you want is having them burrow
   underground to regenerate. Kill them before they regenerate or get away.

3. Roach: Make more roach then he has and upgrade them.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Siege Tank: Since they have high regeneration, you have to use brute force
   to kill them before they have the chance to regenerate.

2. Raven: With detection, you prevent them from regenerating or
   fleeing through burrow.

3. Thor: They do 60 damage against them and can tank alot of hits.
   Don't send them alone though, pair them with other strong units.

4. Marauder: Good counter against early roaches.
   You'll be surprised how effective they are against them.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Immortal: The best unit in owning armored types since they kill a roach
   in 3 shots while taking a measly 10 damage.

2. Observer: You don't want to let them get away and regenerate do you?

3. Stalker: A good mass of stalkers will always beat mass roaches.

Counter as zerg: 
1. Roach: You will easily kill them before they kill you.

2. Ultralisk: You can also charge at them since Hydralisks like to stand
   still and shoot.

3. Brood Lord: As long as they don't catch up with you, you will
   do excellent damage on them.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Siege Tank: Easily the best counter. They do 35 damage a shot and
   severely outranges them.

2. Raven: The Hunter Seeker Missile can kill multiple Hydralisks and
   the point defense drone can absorb many shots from the hydralisks.
   Of course you can piss them off too by building some turrets.

3. Marine: 1 marine against 1 hydralisk will lose, but 3 or more marines
   will easily defeat a hydralisk. With combat shield and large mass, imagine
   how easily they will defeat hydralisks.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. High Templar: Since hydralisks like to stand and shoot, 1 full
   storm can take multiple hydras out.

2. Dark Templar: Kills a hydralisk in 2 hits and its invisible.

3. Zealot: Zealot do excellent against hydras. Make sure you support
   them with guardian shield.

4. Sentry: Lessen the damage, but keep them safe though...

3. Hydralisk: Same as Roach, but dies easily if the infested marines comes.

Counter as Terran:

   you can just charge the laser on them.

   are slow and can't catch up with those stalkers.


Note: If you are using ground units against Ultralisks, always spread your
      units to minimize the damage of the Kaiser Blades.

Cost: 100 minerals 100 gas
Build Speed: 33
Special Abilities: Bounce: The Glave Wurm can bounce up to 2 times after
                   striking the opponent. (Passive)

Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Corruptor: Somehow, 1 corruptor easily defeats 2 mutalisk while
   costing only 50 minerals more.

2. Hydralisk: Somehow effective. (In SC1 Mutalisk dominates hydras.)

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: Easily the best counter with its 20 damage an attack.

2. Thor: With its 48 damage an attack and a range of 10, they kill
   those mutalisks before they can even see the Thor.
   And with its 400 hp, it can survive alot of punishment.

3. Bunker or Turrets: Mutalisks has been known for hit and run tactics.
   Thats bad for you if he harrass you multiple times.
   Jamming a bunker full with marines or building turrets everywhere and
   say goodbye to those mutalisk if they dare to come again.

4. Battlecruiser: Tech and resource heavy, but its a good alternative strategy
   Beware that this big armada is slow as hell.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Phoenix: 20 damage + fast firing rate = dead mutalisks.
   You can even kite those mutalisks in a funny way.

2. Stalker: They can defeat those mutalisks for you if you didn't
   had time to create phoenixes.

3. Archon: They really own Mutalisks, but they can't catch up with them.
   Good players with good micro can defeat an archon without
   it even touching those Mutalisks.

4. Photon Cannon: A must if you already know hes gonna build mutalisks.

Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Hydralisk: Free hits on those corruptors.

2. Corruptor: Make more corruptors then he has and upgrade them.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Thor: Again, free hits since the corruptor doesn't target ground.

2. Viking: Cheaper and yet it dominates the corruptor.

3. Marine: They shoot air and thats all you need.

Counter as Protoss: 
1. Stalker: Free hits.

2. Void Ray: Void Rays charges their beam easily on corruptors so it
   will be easy kills if you manage to charge it up.

3. Archon: Again, they own corruptors and mutalisks, but their slowness and
   lack of range makes it hard to catch them.

Upgrades: None
Counter as zerg: 
1. Corruptor: Free hits, as long as you take out other units that can shoot
   air like hydralisk or other corruptors.

2. Mutalisk: Works like corruptor but less effective.

Counter as Terran: 
1. Viking: 20 damage an attack, so Brood Lords won't last long.

3. Raven: Their Broodling Strikes will be countered by the drone.

Counter as Protoss:

7. Q&A
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I can't seem to find an use for the EMP, I find it quite useless...
A: The EMP has many great uses for example against Protoss.
   It removes 100 shield if hit by the EMP and losing shield = bad for protoss
   Another good use is against units like Mothership.
   1 EMP and all energy is gone, disabling the skills.

Q: Why do you prefer shooting the interceptors instead of instantly targetting
   Carrier?
A: There are many changes brought to the Carrier and one of the noticed ones
   is that the Interceptors no longer heal themself if they get back to the
   Carrier.
   If you shoot down those interceptors first, you won't take more damage.

Q: Whaha Battlecruiser only does 8 damage against enemies,
   what a worthless unit.
A: Not really a question, but notice the firing speed of
   the battlecruiser is 0.23 = nearly 4 shots in 1 second.
   Meaning in 1 second, it can do 24 DAMAGE, which is alot.
   Also the battlecruiser has a Yamato Cannon that deals 300 damage.
   Do you still think its worthless now?

Q: Are you the one that mailed the strategy to BlackDra90n
   about the rush strategy?
A: Why are you asking anyway? But just to answer it, yes it was me.

Q: So why is ur name the Dinokiller14?
A: Because I am dinokiller :P someone took my name so I had
   to add some numbers.

Q: Can I add you on Starcraft 2?
A: Sure, my ign is dinokiller. Friend code is 358
   Just... don't piss me off :P

Q: UR GIDE SUCKS BA11S I CaM DO PFETTER.
A: I dont care if you can do better, better improve on your grammar.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section under me is what I call the retarded questioners section.
These mailers seem to have failen in life and lives in the shadows behind a
computer that never seems to go off. (I figure hate mails doesn't fit here)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What happens when you click your mouse?
A: Go figure out yourself.

Q: How do I create units?
A: Seriously...
