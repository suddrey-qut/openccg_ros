Section 01 - Guide Information
==============================

This guide is a total walkthrough for Starcraft 2, with a focus on
earning achievements.  The flow of the guide will begin with the Wings
of Liberty Campaign and then move into playing online against computers,
first on your own, then with other players and then finally player vs
player.

Starcraft 2 is not a game where you can just always follow a guide, it
is a game that requires a level of skill to advance.  The sad reality
is that some achievements will simply be beyond your ability to
achieve.

GI01 - Using This Guide
=======================

Each section has its own table of contents and search commands.  Use the
search commands to jump to a section.  Example: to jump to the Wings of
Liberty Walkthrough, hit Ctrl F and enter SC2A.

Search codes will never use the letter o in a code that uses any
number, this will help avoid confusion in codes that use numbers.

Achievements that earn a reward are marked with (portrait, decal, etc).

Achievements that have multiples are marked x#.

You will complete some achievements just by playing the game, as in
there is no need to go out of your way to complete them.  Any of these
achievements will be marked with ****.  How you earn them is blatantly
described in the achievement in the game and requires no strategy. In
some achievements you can click the achievement to see your progress.





GI02 - General Game Tips
========================

1. Once you earn an achievement it can not be unearned.

2. If you earn an achievement during a game, you do not have to win the
game to keep the achievement.

3. You can complete achievements on harder difficulties and still get
credit for them.  For example: playing on hard in the campaign, you can
complete normal difficulty achievements.

4. In Cooperative or Custom games, you can play against more difficult
computer opponents and gain credit for all lower difficulty
achievements.  If you only play against Insane AI opponents, you will
obtain all difficulty level achievements at once.

5. Playing as Random gives you credit for Random race achievements,
and you also get credit for which ever race you were in the game.  So
playing as Random gives you twice the progress with achievements.

6. You can play the campaign on any difficulty and then after you
complete the game when you continue it will load the mission archive
and allow you to play any mission on any difficulty, using the upgrades,
research and mercinaries you had at the time of each mission.





GI03 - FAQ's
============

Q: How do I do a successful cannon rush?
A: Send all workers on minerals, as soon as the first worker returns
with a pile of minerals, send it to the enemies base.  Build a Pylon as
soon as you can, just outside of the computers vision and general
building area.  As soon as the pylon is complete, build a forge.  Train
a few more Probes and as soon as you can, build 2 Photon Cannons.
Build another Pylon closer to the computers base, but within range of
your cannons, and just keep pushing in with more cannons and Pylons.

Q: How do I beat "All In" on brutal?
A: The only way I know to beat it is by having the Mind Control towers
researched.  Build them all over the defensive choke points and up on
the platform with the artifact.  Regardless of which version you play
on, mind control the most powerful Zerg units, Ultralisks, Brood Lords,
etc, and keep them back in your base for when Kerrigan attacks.  You
will also obviously need to build a strong defence of Siege Tanks,
bunkers, turrets and at least 2 mobile forces.

Q: Do insane computer oppents recieve a resource bonus?
A: Yes.  For minerals they receive 7 and for gas they receive 6.

Q: I won a non custom game but didn't get a win in achievements, why?
A: As of patch 1.1.2 Blizzard has put a minimum time on qualifying for
a win in games.  A game must be at least 5 minutes longbefore you get
credit for the win.

Q: How many workers should I have on minerals?
A: If there are 8 mineral deposits and we use 16 workers for a 2:1
ratio, you will mine roughly 90% more minerals in the same amount of
time over a 1:1 ratio.  From there the benefit declines rapidly, a 3:1
ratio is only approximately 120% more efficent than a 1:1 ratio.  So
using somewhere between 2:1 and 3:1 or in other words, between 16 and
24 is ideal.

==========================
Section 03 - Single Player
==========================

While Starcraft 2 is primarily a multi-player game, it does have a
significant amount of single player content.  This section will walk
you through the campaign missions, and help you earn achievements
and rewards.  As well as introduce you to the melee settings against
computer opponents, the stepping stone to player vs player competition.





============================================
SC2A - Wings of Liberty Campaign Walkthrough
============================================

The Wings of Liberty campaign is the Terran story mode and Blizzard
Entertainment made it sort of open ended.  You only have to
complete a small amount of the missions to complete the story, or if you
want to finish everything, you can do so in which ever order of
available missions you want.  In addition to completing the missions how
you want to, you are also able to choose which units to upgrade, which
technologies to research and which mercenaries to higher.

It is worth noting that you can not in a single campaign play all the
missions, and have all upgrades, researched technology and mercenaries.

Tip: You can complete all the missions on normal or hard, or even
casual, and then go back and play them on the harder difficulties.
You will also be able to play the alternate missions (Safe Haven or
Haven's Fall for example).  The one exception is the Piercing the
Shroud mission, if you do not unlock it during the campaign you will
have to start a new campaign to get it.

I am writing all strategies based on playing on the hard setting and
accomplishing all achievements in 1 try.  I also am not spending any
credits on upgrades or mercenaries.  But you must not forget to spend
your credits and research new technologies.

LA01 - Liberation Day  (mission)
================================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Logistics Headquarters
> Raynor Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Destroy Dominion Holoboards (6)

Walk down the road, after killing the first group of dominion marines
you will obtain the bonus objective.  Force attack the holoboard (1/6).

After the first auto-save you will see a group of dominion marines, wait
for your re-enforcements to drop down.  Time it right and you should
only lose 1-2 marines on hard.  Force attack the holoboard (2/6).

Just south of that main square are a few marines and another holoboard.
Force attack the Holoboard (3/6).

Go west, sticking to the south side of the square to find the next
holoboard.  Force attack the holoboard (4/6).

Continue on to the north until the cut scene with the locals being put
on a truck.  Kill the marines and the truck, then force attack the
holoboard (5/6).

Continue on and you will see the next holoboard, force attack the
holoboard (6/6).

Keep going and let the civilians lead the way so they take the first
damage, kill the vikings and then the main building to complete the
mission.



LA02 - Raynor's Back
====================

Kill 5 enemies with Raynor on normal.  To do this, keep Raynor at the
front and let him take the first hit.  You will most likely get this
achievement without having to try.



LA03 - Down with Mengsk
=======================

Kill every enemy on hard difficulty.  Scout out the map as you go,
enemies do not re-spawn so once they are dead you should be alright.





LA04 - The Outlaws  (mission)
=============================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Dominion Base
Bonus Objectives
> Rescue the Rebels

This mission is very easy, build your base and train more marines and
medics.  Follow the linear path until you obtain the objective to
rescue the rebels.  All you have to do is move any marine onto the
green marker.

Keep training forces and moving forward with your troops.  Use way
points for your barracks to send your troops closer to where you are
fighting.

Build up a good enough force before moving on, you will have to fight
a bunker and then destroy the dominion base.  Once the base is dead the
mission is complete.

See LA06 for additional strategies.



LA05 - Cash Reward
==================

Collect all mineral and gas pallets on normal.  There are 6 mineral and
3 gas pallets.

The first gas and mineral pallet are just north of your base and get
highlighted for you.  The next 3 mineral pallets are in a little area
off the north side of the road, just past the first set.

The next 2 mineral and gas pallets are inside the area where the rebels
are.  1 gas on the west side, 1 mineral and gas by the large building
on the north side, and 1 mineral pallet beside the buildings on the
south end.



LA06 - Be Quick of Be Dead
==========================

Complete the mission in under 10 minutes on hard.  Speed is essential,
don't waste time with your troops standing around, you will likely need
to do this on your 2nd attempt after learning the level.

Start by immediately sending your starting marines on a path to the
north to collect the resource pallets.  While they are on their way,
start building SCV's and more marines.  Also build another barracks and
more supply depots.

Once your marines have collected the first resources, continue moving
them forward and rescue the rebel forces.

Use way points from your barracks to send your new troops immediately
to a position closer to your present forces location.  Also you can
assign a control group for your barracks so you can build more troops
without having to go back to your base.

Once you've rescued the rebels, you will need roughly 8-10 marines to
get through the upcoming bunker, as well as at least 4 medics.

You may want to hold at this position for a minute or 2 while you
wait for your troops to catch up, ideally you will have 12 marines and
6 medics.

When you are in the dominion base, kill all offensive units, then
focus fire on the first barracks, stopping only when new dominion units
are trained.  After the first bunker, do the same to the next one, then
the factory.  Also allow your units to kill any SCV's that try to make
repairs.

Keep training marines and don't forget to use the way points for your
barracks.





LA07 - Zero Hour  (mission)
===========================

Main Objectives
> Hold Out for Evacuation
Bonus Objectives
> Rescue the Rebels (3)

The key to this mission is to have a strong base and an offensive force
to rescue the rebels. Build additional barracks, train 2 SCV's for each
mineral deposit, have 3 SCV's on gas and don't forget to build plenty of
supply depots.  Also, take advantage of the engineering bay to upgrade
your ground units attack and defense.

Build Missile Turrets and additional bunkers, keep a small group of
marines and medics inside your base to kill Zerg units that will be
dropped into your base behind your defensive lines.

At the very start load 4 marines into each bunker at each bridge,
ignore the 2 bunkers near your command center.

When you get the messages from the rebels, it is easier to rescue them
immediately than if you wait.  You will know where the rebels are by a
ping on your mini-map.  The first group is north east of your base, the
second is north and slightly to the west of your base, the third is
north east of your base.

The first group will call out for a rescue with just under 18:00, send
the 8 extra marines you started with to rescue them.  You will run into
a few buried Zerg units, its not significant enough to need medics.

Once you have the units rescue you need to get back to your base (1/3).

The second group will call out with just over 14:00 remaining.  Again it
is easier to rescue them immediately than waiting.  You will want at
least 12 marines and 6 medics as you may get attacked by a Zerg
offensive force in addition to the buried Zerg forces near the rebels.
Rescue the rebels and head back to your base (2/3).

With around 09:00 remaining the third group will call out for a rescue.
You will want a much larger force this time as the Zerg will have
defensive spine crawlers and more units.  Once you rescue the rebels
head back to your base (3/3).

Now just hold out until the count down timer runs out.



LA08 - Hold the Line
====================

Complete the mission without losing or salvaging a structure on normal.
Salvaging is unique to bunkers in that you can press the salvage button
receive minerals. Simply don't use that option.

The best way to ensure you receive this achievement is to have SCV's
at both bridges to repair your structures.  Your SCV's have an auto
repair function, allow them to use it, only forcing them to repair a
structure if it enters the red zone and they are repairing a different
structure.

If you're playing on Hard difficulty, you may need to replay this level
on normal difficulty as this can be difficult on hard.

Use save points in case if you lose a structure so you can try again.

You need at least 3 SCV's at each bridge for repairing your bunkers,
also have supply depots blocking the path of Zerglings.  Build
additional Missile Turrets.  The earlier you do this the better.  If
you are having troubles with this objective, it may be easier to
complete it on its own, ignoring the other achievements.

Just focus on defense if you are completing this achievement on its own.

Use extra SCV's for repairs if you need to.



LA09 - The Best Defense...
==========================

Destroy 4 Zerg hatcheries on hard.  This means you need to build a solid
defense and still have an offensive force capable of taking out
fortified Zerg bases.

The key to completing this objective is having a strong economy and a
good base.  Build additional barracks, train 2 SCV's for each mineral
deposit, have 3 SCV's on gas and don't forget to build plenty of
supply depots.  Also, take advantage of the engineering bay to upgrade
your ground units attack and defense.

You need at least 3 SCV's at each bridge for repairing your bunkers,
also have supply depots blocking the path of Zerglings.  Build
additional Missile Turrets.  The earlier you do this the better.  If
you are having troubles with this objective, it may be easier to
complete it on its own, ignoring the other achievements.

If completing this achievement on its own, just hold out until you have
a strong enough force to complete it in the final 9 minutes.

Start by going to the south west corner, immediately after rescuing the
third group of rebels.  You will need at least 16 marines and 8 medics,
with constant re-enforcements.  I recommend 24 marines and 12 medics.

Use way points and control groups for your barracks to keep bringing in
reinforcements.

When you get to the first base, use hit and run techniques to draw out
units and avoid fighting units while in range of spine crawlers.

Slowly move into the base and once in range of the hatcheries there are
2 spine crawlers, use part of your force to attack the spine crawlers
while using the rest of your force to attack units.  Once the spine
crawlers are dead, use the split forces to attack hatcheries 1 at a time
while the rest of your units kill any forces the Zerg builds.

Pay attention to your re-enforcements as the Zerg will build up between
your base and your attacking force.

Once the 3 hatcheries are dead get the hell out of their, you need at
least 03:00 left to safely complete this objective.

Move to the north west path directly across from the left west bridge,
move in using the same hit and run tactics.  When you get in, kill the
spine crawler and then focus on the hatchery using a few marines to
kill any units the Zerg has.

LB01 - The Evacuation  (mission)
================================

Main Objectives
> Reach Dr. Hanson's Settlement
> Escort Colonists to the Colony Ships (50)
> Do Not Let 20 Colonists Die (20)
Bonus Objectives
> Collect Chrysalis DNA (3 Zerg Research)

From the start use your firebats and medics to move west, there is a
mineral pallet and gas pallet on the way, you may as well grab them.
Once you reach the marker the first main objective will be complete and
you will gain control of the base, and you will have the 2nd and 3rd
main objectives.

Immediately start training SCV's, upgrading your units, building supply
depots, barracks, etc.  Prepare a small force to guard the first truck.

I honestly do not know how you can let any trucks die, let alone
colonists.  So I am writing assuming you don't lose any trucks and only
have to deal with 5 runs (on hard).

You can right click your units to follow the transport truck and they
will attack any units they run into.

There are various mineral and gas pallets throughout the map.  You can
find a few of them along the road, and 1 in your base.  Then even more
on the paths off the main road.

At the end of the first run you will be made aware of a Chrysalis Cocoon
and receive the bonus objective.  Simply bring any unit onto the
Chrysalis to collect it (1/3).

On the way back from escorting the 2nd transport you will need to
collect the 2nd and 3rd Chrysalis  The second is on the path to the
south east of the northern most bunker.  Do not go east into the Zerg
base, ignore it and follow the path south.  Kill the Zerg units around
the Chrysalis and send a unit to pick it up (2/3).

The next Chrysalis is west of the southern bunker.  When you find the
third Chrysalis, kill the Zerg units near it and send a unit to pick it
up (3/3).

For the rest of the transport runs, you will encounter a stronger Zerg
presence, pay close attention to protecting it.



LB02 - Handle With Care
=======================

Do not lose a transport truck on normal.  This is very easy, just have
a strong force with the transport truck and it will be fine.  You don't
need to worry about defending your base as it won't be attacked.



LB03 - Sacrifice Nothing
========================

Do not lose or salvage a structure on hard.  Salvage is an option on
bunkers, do not use it.  This achievement can be a bit harder as you
need to fill the bunkers with units and have additional units with the
bunker at all times.

You can access bunker upgrades prior to this mission to make this
achievement a bit easier.

2 marines, 1 firebats and 2 medics at each bunker should be enough, with
4 marines in each bunker of course.  Don't forget to have at least 1
SCV at each bunker as well.

Once you're on the 4th and 5th run, you will want additional units at
the bunkers.





LB04 - Outbreak  (mission)
==========================

Main Objectives
> Cleanse the Infestation (144 structures)
Bonus Objectives
> Kill the Infestors (2 Zerg Research)

Immediately begin by training more SCV's and sending out the units you
start with to destroy some infested buildings, with 20 seconds before
night fall, bring your units back.

You should start by clearing all the infested buildings north of your
base and work south.

During the night, build your base and bunkers, train units and get ready
for the day light minutes where you will need to work fast.  Marines
destroy buildings faster than firebats or hellions, so train many
marines.

At the first night fall the units you start with will be enough to
defend your base, but you should also be quick at getting your defense
up.  Do not forget your upgrades at the engineering bay.

During the 2nd day you should be able to destroy enough infested
buildings to have less than 100 left.  This is essential if you plan on
winning by the 5th night.

Again, with 20-30 seconds left of daylight, head back to your base.

By the 3rd day you need to have a large enough force to really take on
the Zerg, there are defended bases in the south.

At the start of the 2nd night you will get the bonus objective to kill
the Zerg Infestors.

Near the end of the 2nd night the south barrier will be broken, you
should have a force ready to defend that location.

To kill the Infestors you will need units at the 2 locations at the end
of the day time, so that at the turn from day to night, your units can
kill the infestors and have time to run back to your base.

Take all your units, even those in bunkers and start killing infested
buildings during the day time.

Just keep doing this till you win.



LB05 - 28 Minutes Later
=======================

Complete the mission on normal difficulty before the 5th night.  This
is actually kind of hard to do on hard, but on normal it should be no
problem.  Just be very aggressive during the day, using 2 or 3 offensive
groups in different areas at the same time.

Playing on normal you should be able to do this by the end of the 3rd
day.

See LB04 for strategies.



LB06 - Army of Darkness
=======================

Destroy 15 infested buildings during night on hard.  This is quite
difficult as when you attack an infested building multiple enemy units
will spawn.

The only real strategy is to wait until you are nearly done and have a
strong force.  But if you are accomplishing this achievement and the
28 minutes later achievement, you will be in for a hard time.

Its best to have 2 groups in 1 area at night, keep 1 group back, and the
other attacking 1 building at a time using the shift attack command,
(hold shift and click 1 building after the other) and use the second
group to kill units only, this will limit the amount of spawns.

Also, if you simply save 15 infested buildings at the end of a day,
you can wait for night and kill them to complete the mission.  You can
even weaken them to 1 red block of health so that as soon as its
night you can shift command an attack order on the buildings, ignoring
the units and as soon as the buildings are dead you will be victorious.





LB07 - Safe Haven  (mission)
============================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Protoss Nexus (3)
> Destroy the Purifier Mothership
Bonus Objectives
> Stop the First Terror Fleet
> Stop the Second Terror Fleet
> Stop the Third Terror Fleet

You may not end up with one or more of the Bonus objectives, completing
the mission with less has no effect on the result, as long as you do
not fail any you do acquire.

Start out by setting up your economy, building SCV's and training more
units.  Your best bet is to train as many Vikings as you can.

The Protoss Nexus you need to destroy are marked on your map.

When the first Protoss Fleet is on its way to an Outpost, you need to
send your vikings and destroy the fleet before it kills the colony
ship.  This will complete the first bonus objective.

You can kill the Nexus to the east of your base by using vikings to
take out the warp prisms that power the photon cannons.  Once the
cannons are deactivated, land a few vikings on the cliff to the east
of the Nexus and you can take it out safely.

You can do the same for the south east base, the cliff is on the west
side of the Nexus.

The last base is a bit more difficult.  Use your Vikings to kill the
warp prisms, then transform them outside the base and walk in with
them.

Once the third Nexus is destroyed, you will be able to destroy the
Mothership.



LB08 - You Shall Not Pass
=========================

Save 3 Outposts on normal.  See the next achievement for strategies.



LB09 - My Precious
==================

Save 2 Outposts on hard.  Every time you are warned that a Protoss
Fleet is on its way to an Outpost, send your vikings to destroy it.

In between destroying the Protoss fleet, you will need to take out the
Protoss Nexus.

The Outposts are the white bases, including the one in your base, to
save 3 you need to stop the Mothership before it destroys the 3rd base,
which is the one in the middle east side.

See LB07 for more strategies.





LB10 - Haven's Fall  (mission)
==============================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Zerg Infestation (4)

Start as always by getting your economy going, training new units,
upgrading and setting up defenses  Build plenty of supply depots,
train a few medics and use the starting ground forces as your
defense  Once your economy is going you will start getting the
messages to save the colonist settlements.

I recommend using just vikings as your offensive units, if you build
enough you can make it all over the map quickly and have the best
results.

Just keep defending and using your vikings to take out the bases.

After you save the first settlement, take out the Zerg base just north
east of your base.

After the 2nd and 3rd settlements are saved or lost, start taking out
the other Zerg bases, they are marked on your map.

Just keep hitting the Zerg bases until they are eliminated.



LB11 - Outpatient
=================

Complete the mission with 3 settlements protected on normal.  See the
next achievement for strategies.



LB12 - House Call
=================

Complete the mission with 5 settlements protected on hard.  This simply
requires you to pay attention to incoming messages.  When ever you are
informed that a settlement is under attack you will need to go rescue
it.

I recommend using just vikings as your offensive units, if you build
enough you can make it all over the map quickly and have the best
results.

The first is the one south of your base, you don't have long to build
a force up to attack it.  If you fail to save this settlement, you did
not have a good enough starting, restart immediately and try again.

The second is east of your base.  You should have no problem flying
to it and taking it out.

By now you should be well off enough to start hitting the other Zerg
bases, start with the one just north east of your base.

The third is in the south east.  Again, fly to it and destroy the Zerg.

Keep killing the Zerg bases between saving the settlements.

The fourth is in the far north east.

The fifth is in the middle of the map.

If you haven't won by this point, the Zerg will try to infest the
settlements at random.

See LB10 for more strategies.

LC01 - The Devil's Playground  (mission)
========================================

Main Objectives
> Gather 8000 Minerals
Bonus Objectives
> Locate Tosh's Miners
> Kill the Brutalisk (3 Zerg research)

Start by immediately building some SCV's and sending the way point onto
the nearby minerals.  Do not bother building any units.  You can beat
this mission without spending any minerals.

After the first lava surge fades you will get the first bonus objective.
Tosh's miners are just north of your base, bring a marine or reaper to
the location to rescue them.

Shortly after you get that objective you will get the next bonus
objective to kill the Brutalisk.  The Brutalisk is in the far south west
corner of the map.

Mine out the resources near your base first, then when they are all
depleted, simply fly your base to the next mineral area of your choice.

Again, there is no need to spend money, you can use the Reapers to find
more reapers and you will not have to worry too much about defense

I only built 1 bunker and had 4 warpigs sitting in it, and had a couple
medics and an SCV beside it, I used the medics to heal my reapers when
I brought them back to my base.

You can run around with your reapers collecting mineral pallets, and
finding more reapers, if you do lots of running you will gain units
without having to spend money.

Just mine away and you can have 8000 minerals in about 10 minutes.

You can even use a couple reapers to kill the Brutalisk, which will also
complete the next achievement if you're on at least normal.

If you choose to shoot the Brutalisk to death, bring plenty of reapers,
marines and medics.

Just sit back and mine minerals without spending any to win easily.



LC02 - Red Lobster
==================

Kill the Brutalisk with lava on normal difficulty.  This is fairly easy
on any difficulty.  Just simply send a couple reapers down to him about
20 seconds before the next lava surge, attack it, and make it follow
your units into a low zone.  Let your units die if you need to, but
make sure the Brutalisk is in the low zone when the lava comes up.

The Brutalisks location is marked on your map after the first lava
surge fades, it is in the far south west corner.



LC03 - Reaper Man
=================

Locate all of Tosh's Crew on hard.  There are a total of X groups.  I
will describe where they are, its up to you to decide if you just race
a couple reapers through and get them, or fight your way in and get
them.

The first group is just east of Tosh's miners.

The second group is just east of the Brutalisk, up on a ledge south of
a hatchery.

The third group is east of the second on a ledge south of another
hatchery.

The fourth group is directly east from your starting base, up on a
small ledge, kind of in the middle of nothing.

The fifth and final group is on the far east side of the map, directly
east from the fourth group.  They are on a rock ledge behind the Zerg
base.





LC04 - Welcome to the Jungle  (mission)
=======================================

Main Objectives
> Gather Terrazine (7)
> Protoss Can't Seal 7 Altars
Bonus Objectives
> Find Protoss Relics (3 Protoss Research)

Start as always by setting up your economy, build SCV's, new units and
upgrades.

Immediately send an SCV with your starting Goliaths to the Terrazine
location west of your base.

By the time you have the first Terrazine back to your base, you will
need to be ready to move against the Protoss as they will begin trying
to close off the altars.

If you decide to mass Goliaths, you will want to bring SCV's with them
for repairs, by doing so you will have a strong enough force that does
not need constant re-enforcements, allowing you to divide your army
and get multiple Terrazine altars at once.

Basically, just bring an SCV with you when the Protoss attempt to seal
and altar, after stopping the attempt, collect the Terrazine.

Repeat until you have all you need.

The Protoss base north of you is worth taking out as it will hinder
your ability to move about the map.  If you choose to expand here,
defend it as well.

For the Relics, they are easy to get in between the Protoss attempts
to seal altars.  After the first attempt, just north of your base is
a relic, send any unit to collect it (1/3).

The next relic is between the 2 altars on the west side of the map,
when you find it use a unit to collect it (2/3).

The last relic is in the north east corner between 2 altars, you need
to go up and around to get it or you can use a viking and land on it
to collect it (3/3).



LC05 - Appetite for Destruction
===============================

Prevent any SCV's from being killed on normal.  This is really basic,
as your base should be defended, you only need to worry about the SCV's
you use to acquire the Terrazine gas.

To do so you really need to make sure you have a strong force, with
anti-air units, such as the Goliath  Just keep up the protection and
use save points in case you do lose one.



LC06 - It's So Easy
===================

Prevent the Protoss from capping a Tal'darim Altar on hard.  Every time
you are warned that the Protoss is attempting to cap an altar, you need
to have your offensive force make there way to the altar that is marked
on your mini-map.

Send an SCV with your force and acquire Terrazine gas after preventing
the Protoss from capping the altar.

The altars get harder and harder to reach the longer you wait, so its
best to beat the mission as quickly as possible.  Send out SCV's with
a small force and acquire your first 2 sources of Terrazine within the
first few minutes of the mission.

You will likely end up having to sacrifice part of your force to kill
a probe, if this happens, take a moment to regroup.

If you have problems with this achievement, sit back and slowly kill
all the Protoss forces around the Terrazine altars, so that you can
have 2 groups, 1 to defend your SCV when you acquire the Terrazine and
1 force to stop Protoss attempts of sealing altars.

The best units to use are Marauders, Goliaths, and Vikings.

Another tip is to use a couple Reapers, or marines and send them in
targeted on the Probe sealing an altar, sacrificing a couple low end
units is a better strategy than losing a large part of your army.





LC07 - Breakout  (mission)
==========================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Main Prison Base
> Tosh Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Kill Guards at Cell Block A
> Kill Guards at Cell Block B

From the start just move forward killing a couple Marines.  When you
get the Mindblast ability use it on the Missile Turret and Marines,
kill the Marines and turret and move north west, follow the edge and
you will get the next ability.  Use the Psi Shield and move to the
Siege Tank and kill it where it can't hit you.

Leave the Turret and move up the ramp, from there you can safely
destroy the nearby Siege Tank and Bunker.  Once both are dead, wait for
some of Raynor's forces to attack, join in and slowly work away at the
other bunker and the forces in general.

Once this first line of defense is destroyed, move in and destroy the
Turret.  Move down the next path and you will run into an EMP, and get
the next ability, consumption.  use consumption, a lot, it regenerates
your energy.  Its best to use it on units with more life.

You will need to have Raynors forces able to come with you, so make
sure the small base behind you is destroyed as this will set up a new
offensive point for Raynor.

Use Psi Shield and Mindblast to kill the Turret and then kill the
Siege Tanks and finally the Bunkers.  You will get the first bonus
objective here.

Move up the north west path, there is a large group of enemy units,
Mindblast them, use Psi Shield and move in and kill the Turret, then
just waste the guards, this will complete the first bonus objective.

As you move back south you will see a path with an Arrow, you can go
down that path and kill a Turret, do it.  Then just join forces with
Raynors troops and take out the Bunkers and Siege Tanks, use your
abilities frequently, especially consumption.

Once this defense point is finished, move on.  Kill the Factory and its
extension to set up the next forward defense point for Raynor.  Around
the corner is the second bonus objective.

Take Tosh carefully into the area, you can sneak into the lower south
east corner and take out the first tank.  Use Mindblast on the group of
units and then work on the other Siege Tank and Raven.  Slaughter the
rest of the units and this objective will be complete.  Go Consume a
couple friendlies and make the final push into the end area.

You will get a few nukes, use the first one to take out the Bunkers.
Then move in through the door and use the next nuke by one of the 2
Thor units.  Now use Psi Shield and Mindlbast on the opposite Turret
and destroy the Turret.  Use your next nuke at the top of the ramp and
the last nuke right where the Siege Tank is near the back of the area.

There should be no detectors left at the top.  Carefully sneak around
the zones you can be detected in and kill Siege Tanks and Turrets.
Eventually Raynors forces will overwhelm the base, but they can't if
there are Siege Tanks.

This should complete the mission for you.




LC08 - Cool Hand Tosh
=====================

Complete the mission without Tosh going below 100 life on normal.  Its
not too hard, the best strategy is to save often using a couple
different save files.  If he does drop even close to 100 life, reload
and try again.



LC09 - Jailhouse Rock
=====================

Complete the mission on hard in under 25 minutes.  Beat it once just to
get a feel for it, and then go again pushing hard.  Its best to do
this achievement on its own.

See LC07, I wrote it based on accomplishing this achievement.





LC10 - Ghost of a Chance  (mission)
===================================

Main Objectives
> Destroy Jorium Stockpile
> Destroy Terrazine Tank
> Destroy Psi-Indoctrinator
> Nova Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Kill Spectres (10)

Any TPR# are references for LC12 and can be ignored if you are not
playing on hard, or do not care about that achievement.

Start by assigning Nova to one control group and your Marines on
another control group.

Use your marines to move forward and take out the bunker, then move
up the ramp and kill the units and the Turret.

Now use Nova.  With Nova Snipe uses no energy, so use it as much as
you can.  Move her along the path until the generator, now bring your
Marines to Nova.

Move Nova forward and kill the Marauders and Goliath.  Then bring your
Marines and Medics forward and as a group go up the next ramp.  After
the Missile Turrets are dead, use just Nova and move down the ramp.

Be cautious of the Raven's vision range, get close enough and
Dominate the Siege Tank.  Use your Marines to drag the group of
Tosh's troops south to the south, back into Range of your Siege
Tank.  TPR1 TPR2

Kill the Siege Tank and then use Nova to move forward up the ramp,
you will get the bonus objective here.  Snipe the first Spectre up the
second ramp on the south side of the platform (1/10).

Move back down the ramp and go up the north ramp, be cautious here,
there is a Specter to the west, snipe him (2/10).

Now move forward slowly and hold, bring your Marines and Medics up to
just before the 2nd ramp.  Use Dominate on one of the Battlecruisers
and immediately send your Marines into battle.  TPR3

In the next area you will have only Nova at first, use her to move
forward, when you see the units coming at you, dominate either the
Diamondback or the Raven.  It doesn't matter which.  Kill all the
units and you will get some reinforcements.  TPR4

Set up your Siege Tanks in siege mode beside the door, then fly over
with your Raven and your tanks will destroy the enemy Siege Tank, then
use an Auto Turret to distract the Marines, send your Reapers in to
finish off the enemy Marines.

Bring Nova along the path until she can see the Bunker, set up your
tanks to take it and the turret out.  TPR5

Now move forward again with Nova.  After you go down the next ramp, go
up the ramp just to the north, Dominate the Siege Tank.  Now bring your
Siege Tanks and set them up just below the platform the Dominated tank
is on, guard them with your Reapers and use your Raven to gain vision
and kill Tosh's units.  Kill the Dominated tank.  TPR6

Keep your forces back and then use Nova to move forward to the choke
point, when you hear the nuclear launch detected, move Nova back to
your forces.  Move Nova forward and Snipe the Spectre (3/10).

Now set up your Siege Tanks just a bit from the choke point, watch out
for the Bunker on the ledge.  Now move your Raven in so your tanks can
kill the Bunker, also use Nova to snipe enemy units.

The ramp to the west, move Nova and your Reapers up it, use Nova to
snipe a Firebat and then kill the other and the Medic.  Move Nova
onto the marker to get a nuke.

Now you need to send a Siege Tank to the little platform you
Dominated a Siege Tank on, set it up in the North West corner, this will
destroy a Missile Turret.  Set up the other Siege Tank on the far edge
of the platform west of the Nuke Silo.  This will kill the Turret on
the low ground, now move your Raven to your Siege tank, this will kill
an Auto Turret, now use your Raven to go west a bit and use a Seeker
Missile on the Specter (4/10).  TPR7

Move Nova up the main ramp to the final area of this zone, when you can
see whats up there, use Dominate on the Thor and send your Reapers and
Siege Tanks in.  TPR8

Once the tank is destroyed you will be in a new zone.

Use your Banshee's to move north east and kill the 3 Marines, then use
Nova to Dominate the Siege Tank.  Set the tank on the east side of that
platform, use your Banshee's to add vision to the tank so it can
eliminate the Turret and Bunker, as well as a few Vikings.  Don't kill
the Siege Tank.

Move your forces south east from the starting spot.  Use your Banshee's
to destroy a Siege Tank on a ledge to the east.  Now using Nova move
north, at the top of the ramp there should only be a Raven and a
couple of Auto turrets, use your vikings to take out the Raven and then
move them back, then use the Banshee's and Nova to kill the Auto
Turrets.  Use Nova to get another Nuke.

Now move your forces back to the south, at the mouth of the southern
ramp set up your Siege Tank and use your air units to expand the
vision of the tank and use your units to kill everything that comes
down after your tank.  If the tank survives, kill it.

Now use your Vikings to slowly go east until they can kill the Raven,
then use Nova and the Banshee's to kill the ground units and destroy
the blockade

Dominate the Ultralisk.  Bring the Ultralisk and Nova along the north
path to the marker for a Spectre.  Send the Ultralisk in first, snipe
the Spectre (6/10) and kill the Turrets and Goliath.

Keep going north with Nova and the Ultralisk, past the Nuke Silo 
and then down the ramp, a nuke will be launch, just turn back right 
away and follow the path back down south to the rest of your forces.

Using just Nova and the Ultralisk move east along the path, let the
Ultralisk slaughter the Marines and Turrets, then move further east
and destroy another Turret.  Move north and kill yet another Turret,
this Turret is in a bunch of Tosh's troops, after the Turret is
destroyed hit the Siege Tank.  Your Ultralisk will die.  While it is
doing its job, snipe the Spectre (7/10).

Go back south and Dominate the Thor.  TPR9

Move all your forces to just outside the final zone where the Psi-
Indoctrinator is.  Take Nova and the Dominated Thor down the ramp,
back to where the nuke was earlier.  There is a ramp to the main end
area, this is the back door.  Send the Thor in first, snipe the Spectre
(8/10).  Your Thor will likely die here, if not, kill it.

Take Nova back to your forces, go slowly in the main entrance until
you can see the bulk of the enemy forces, nuke them, this will kill
the last 2 specters (9/10) (10/10).  TPR10

Send your forces in and finish off what ever remains.



LC11 - Dominate Tricks
======================

Use Dominated units to kill at least 15 enemy units on normal.  Easy as
pie, just use Dominate at the right times.



LC12 - Total Protonic Reversal
==============================

Kill every enemy unit on Hard.  Also fairly easy.  there are a few
hidden units that you need to find.  For simplicities sake follow
LC10's instructions and any time you find TPR#, that is a reference to
something specific you must do for this achievement, where the
instructions will appear here.

TPR1 - do not kill the Raven, you will need it.

TPR2 - when you dominate the Siege Tank, you need to keep it alive,
send your Marines and Medics as soon as its been Dominated.  After
clearing the area, move the Siege Tank back to the platform the 2
Missile Turrets were on and use it to destroy the Missile Turret north
of the platform.  Now Dominate the Raven and bring Nova, your Marines
and the Raven back to where the Marines Started, there are 2 Missile
Turrets on a raised platform, use the Raven to launch some Auto
Turrets.

TPR3 - don't forget to kill the Missile Turrets before the Jorium
Stockpile.

TPR4 - go to the far east end of the platform with a Siege Tank, set it
up in Siege mode on the point on the north end, use your Raven to move
slowly north until your Siege Tank can destroy the Missile Turret
without it hitting your Raven.

TPR5 - before moving on there is a Missile Turret on a lower edge to
the South, you can use your Siege Tanks and Raven to destroy it.

TPR6 - Keep your tanks in Siege mode and move your Raven to the small
platform to the east of where the original tank was, be careful as
there is a turret.  Let your tanks kill the Marines and Turret then
send your Reapers up the edge.  Move your Reapers onto the next
platform and kill the Siege Tank, drop down and kill the 2 Marines and
2 Turrets, leave the Bunker.

TPR7 - To the east of the main ramp to get up to the final area in
this zone, set up a Siege Tank as far east as you can, basically on the
low ground by the spinning antenna, use your Raven to move east slowly
until your Siege Tank can destroy the Missile Turret safely.

TPR8 - Before destroying the Terrazine Tank, send a Siege Tank to the
north west corner and have your Raven scout for vision to the west
until you can see the Missile Turret and the Siege Tank destroys it.

TPR9 - to the far north, near the middle of the map, there is a Missile
Turret, use your Banshee's and Vikings (transform them) to take it out.

TPR10 - don't forget to destroy all the turrets and any units that may
be left in this final area, before destroying the Psi-Indoctrinator.

LD01 - The Great Train Robbery  (mission)
=========================================

Main Objectives
> Destroy Dominion Trains (8)
> Don't Miss 3 Trains
Bonus Objectives
> Locate Diamondbacks (6)
> Collect Defiler Bone Samples (3 Zerg Research)

Start by setting up your economy, building SCV's, Supply Depots,
training new units and upgrading weapons and armor.  There are many
mineral pallets throughout the map, some mark where Diamondbacks are.
Also, after every train you kill there will be a large amount of
resource pallets dropped for you.

You will get the first bonus objective near the start of the mission,
the Diamondbacks can be obtained very easily.  Immediately send a marine
to the far west end of your base, there is a path to the first, once
you are near it you will gain control of it (1/6).

The next Diamondback is marked on your map, to the north west, send
the first Diamondback to go get it, its up on a hill behind a fence,
when you are close enough it will be yours (2/6).

The next is just north east of the 2nd, use both Diamondbacks to find
it, it is not marked on your map, but it is west of the last marker.
Once you find it get close enough to it to gain control of it (3/6).

Around this time you should be warned the first train is on its way.

Move south from the 3rd rescued Diamondback and you will find a Zerg
skeleton, send a unit to collect it (1/3).

Send a Diamondback to the last marker, up a little ledge to find
another Diamondback (4/6).

Now just sit on the north train tracks until the first train gets to
your troops, kill the train and head back to your base.

Directly across from the south west exit of your base is a ramp onto
a platform, the next diamondback is up there, send a few units as there
may be marines up there, kill them and get the Diamondback (5/6).

You should have the next train heading out around the time you get
the 5th Diamondback, sit on the tracks and wait for it and then kill
it.

Follow the tracks the second train used until you can see the Zerg
Skeleton, send a unit to collect it (2/3).

South east from the 2nd Zerg Skeleton is a ramp onto high ground, send
a few troops up there and kill any units you run into and you will find
a Diamondback (6/6).

Your base should be attacked around this time, head back and defend it
if you don't have a permanent defense set up.

After that attack on your base the third train will be sent out.  Head
to the far south and wait for it, kill it and then follow the train
track till it curves down in a U shape, on the west side of the track
is a Zerg Skeleton, send a unit to collect it (3/3).

There is a spot to expand north west of your base, if you wish expand
there and set up an even stronger economy.  Either way, keep training
Diamondbacks.

After each train just head back to your base and wait for the next.
The Dominion will use Raven's, an air unit, so you may want to have
some Goliaths or marines ready and with your Diamondbacks.

After the 5th train the Dominion Marauders will be out on patrol.
If you have the time kill them immediately, you want at least 30 seconds
before the next train.  If you have less than that, avoid them until
you have killed the 6th train.  additionally you can simply not kill
them.

Once you've killed the last train, the mission is complete.



LD02 - Bully the Bullies
========================

Kill the Marauder Team on normal.  Very easy, once the Marauders are
out patrolling, they are marked on your mini-map.  Just use a large
force to take em out after taking out a train.



LD03 - Silver Streak
====================

Complete the mission without letting a train get away on hard.  Very
easy, when ever a train is released, just be on the path and kill it.

The Diamondbacks make a good unit for this as they can attack while
moving.

Any time you need to kill a train, the further to the west you are,
the more time you will have to destroy the Train and any guards it may
have.





LD04 - Cutthroat  (mission)
===========================

Main Objectives
> Buy Merc Contract Before Orlan (6000 minerals)
Bonus Objectives
> Find Protoss Relic Contraband (3 Protoss Research)

Start by collecting the resources in your base, if you are not trying
to complete the Solitaire achievement, build up some SCV's and get a
strong economy going.

No matter what you do, the best strategy is to hit Orlans north or
south base as fast as possible to slow his resource collection rate.

When moving about the map, pick up the resources you find.

Outside the south west exit of your base is a crashed ship, destroy it
and you will find a Protoss Relic, send a unit to get it (1/3).

Once you have 2 Medics and the group of free Vultures, move out and
destroy the southern base.

Just west of the southern base is another crash ship you can destroy
to reveal another relic, send a unit to get it (2/3).

Now you can move west and hit the base there, or go back to your base
and regroup and go north.  Assuming you can hit the nearby base, do it.
Once its destroyed, head back to your base and regroup.

As fast as you can, head north and destroy that base.  To the west of
the base is the last Protoss Relic, get it (3/3).

Now its just a matter of collecting the resource pallets scattered
around the map and hitting the goal of 6000 minerals.

Once you have enough you will have control over Mira's base.

You do have quite a large force to take on, so build up a strong army
and get ready.

When you make it up the first ramp watch out for the nuke, back down
and let it hit killing nothing.

Keep moving into the enemy base.  When Orlan's Command Center is nearly
dead you will win.



LD05 - Minesweeper
==================

Kill 25 units with Spider Mines on normal.  This one is just a matter of
placement.  You need to place them at the south west entrance to your
base.  Don't group them, place them in a line, 1 after another, a
vulture length from another, starting on your side of the bride and
working across the bridge's top left side.  You should have about 7
and have them split out slightly on the other side of the bridge.



LD06 - Solitaire
================

Don't train additional SCV's before you get the Contract on hard.  This
is exactly as is it sounds, just don't train any.  Rely on collecting
the resource pallets around the map.





LD07 - Engine of Destruction  (mission)
=======================================

Main Objectives
> Escort Tychus to the Odin
> Tychus Must Survive
> Destroy All Dominion Bases
> Odin Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Find Devourer Tissue Samples (3 Zerg Research)
> Find and Destroy the Loki

You will find the first of the Zerg samples before you find the Odin,
its on the west corner of the lab, send a unit to get it (1/3).

Once you have the Odin the first 2 main objectives are complete and
you will have the 2nd bonus objective.

You now have a base, set up your economy, building lots of SCV's,
build extra because I recommend expanding.  Don't forget to build
supply Depots, new units and upgrade your units attack and defense.

Just protect Tychus in the Odin.  At the 2nd Dominion base you will
find the next Zerg sample at the north east corner, send a ground
unit to pick it up (2/3).

Set up an expansion here, lay down some basic defense, including
Missile Turrets.  You can also set up bunkers and Siege Tanks, with
Missile Turrets at the fork outside of your main base, this will catch
any enemy units trying to attack your expansion.

Just keep following the Odin and between the 3rd and 4th base is the
last Zerg sample, its along a wall, send a unit to grab it (3/3).

After the 4th base is destroyed you will get a message about
Battlecruisers, the Loki is just north of where the Odin is hanging
out, go up and destroy it.  8 Wraiths properly positioned will take
it out no problem.

For the 5th base you only have to worry about the entrance, once you
kill your way in its mission over.



LD08 - Kicking Asgard
=====================

Destroy the Loki on normal.  This is a massive Battlecruiser which is
not very hard to destroy, you just have to find it.  Its located on
the east side of the map in the middle, its north of where the
Odin hangs out before attacking the 5th base.



LD09 - Ragnarok & Roll
======================

Don't let the Odin drop below 30% on hard.  As simple as it sounds,
just have 6 more more SCV's following it around and have a solid
army, especially Vikings or Wraiths to deal with the air units.

30% by the way is 750 health.





LD10 - Media Blitz  (mission)
=============================

Main Objectives
> Destroy Dominion during the Surprise Attack
> Access Broadcast Tower 1
> Access Broadcast Tower 2
> Access Broadcast Tower 3

Don't forget that during this mission you need to go to the south east
corner and destroy a Science Facility to find secret documents which
activate a secret mission.  You can do this at any time, but you must
beat the mission in the same game.

Start by using Barrage on the group of Marines and Hellions, cancel it
as soon as it kills them (1st shot) and finish off the rest of the
units near you.

Its up to you where you wish to attack, but I recommend either
completely destroying the north west base or doing as much damage as
you can to the eastern and northern bases.

Once the surprise attack is over, get some SCV's repairing the Odin,
get your economy going and start building some more units.  Right away
take out the 2 Dominion bases by the minerals outside your base, you
can and should expand.

Build Thors and Siege tanks and get ready to attack the Broadcast
Towers.  When you get to a Broadcast Tower set up your Siege Tanks on
the marker and have your Thors protect them.  Don't forget your SCV's.

At your main base you will need some early Missile Turrets, at least
3.  Also use a Bunker and at least 1 Siege Tank.

Just fight your way through it and you will have the mission complete
in no time.



LD11 - Seek and Destroy
=======================

Destroy an enemy Barracks, Factory and Starport during the surprise
attack on normal.  This is simple, just attack the north west base as
it has all 3 in it.

You can complete this objective and then restart the mission and take
out which ever base(s) you wish, this will give you a stronger
strategical position in the long run.



LD12 - Blitzkrieg
=================

Complete the mission in under 20 minutes on hard.  This can be tough,
the key is to take out all the defenses of the eastern base and as much
of the northern base before the surprise attack is over.

Then as soon as you have 2 Thors, go with the Odin and some SCV's for
repairs and take out the eastern bases structures, send some more
forces during this push and to the first Broadcast Tower.

The Strategy is the same as in LD10, so read that, but with this
achievement you just have to do it fast.





LD13 - Piercing the Shroud  (mission)
=====================================

Main Objectives
> Investigate the Dominion Lab
> Raynor Must Survive
> Destroy the Fusion Reactor
> Escape from the Facility
Bonus Objectives
> Find Protoss Relics (4 Protoss Research)
> Kill Brutalisk (3 Zerg Research)

This is one of those non base building missions where you just get to
command your force and have fun.  You will get various abilities
that have keyboard short cuts, the key to victory is knowing the hotkey
and using them effectively.

A smart move is to try and keep Raynor in the lead and have him take
a lot of the damage, this will help keep your forces alive throughout
the mission.

Move up to the first door and learn to use the Breaching Charge (D),
use one on the door.  Once is open, move in and kill some shit.  Next
jump onto the marker and you can press the green button on the right
hand side of the screen.  You can activate either guns, they have
about the same effect.

When you move into that room you shouldn't lose any units, if you did
load a save point, this mission gets tough and you want as many units
as you can get.

Once in the next room there is a large cell, destroy it ignoring the
Zerglings coming out until its destroyed.  Place a charge on the door
and then save.

Down the next Hallway you will find Grenades (T), they do area
effect damage and will save your ass in tough situations.  Clear out
the rest of this room and move on, when you get to the ramp, go up
and use a Grenade to take out most of the Dominion troops.  Step onto
the marker and activate the security terminal.  Release which ever
units you wish, the effect is nearly the same.

Move into the next room and destroy what ever units are left, then
destroy the large cell to find a Protoss Relic, use a unit to pick it
up (1/4).  Save.  The first of the Main Objectives is done and you
have a new one.

In the next room is a Restoration Charge, you can grab it if you want,
but chances are your units are full on life and energy, so maybe save
it for the moment.

Destroy the door with a Breaching Charge and go pick up the Experimental
Plasma Gun (G), which deals huge damage to a single target.  Move on
down the hall and you will come to a Viking, kill it and then a couple
more units and a Siege Tank, once they are dead there is a marker you
can activate as well as some more Plasma ammo.  Choose which ever
option you want and then follow the war machine into battle, destroy
the barrels of explosives to assist in the destruction.

When your war machine dies, use Grenades and Plasma shots to keep
your troops alive.  If you do this right you won't lose a unit.  At
the other side of the room is another pack of grenades.

In the next room is a Thor, you need to use 2 plasma rounds and a
grenade to kill it without losing a unit, I do this by bringing only
Raynor.  After the Thor is dead, move in and kill anything that is
left.  Activate the marker and chose which ever units you wish, my
preference is Firebats, but they require a lot more micro management,
if your skills aren't that great, go with the Marauders

Save and blow the door open.  You will have the 2nd bonus objective
now.

In this next room, use a grenade to limit the damage your forces take.
Along the south east wall is another pack of grenades and a Restoration
Charge, grab em.  Along the north west wall beside the marker is more
plasma ammo.  When you activate the marker you can release the
Brutalisk.  You will need to use a few plasma rounds and maybe a
grenade, keep your units far from the Brutalisk and have it chase
Raynor.  Have your units on the marker and Raynor on his own, have
Raynor hit it with a plasma shot, then a grenade, run him back to
your units.  You need either Marauders or Firebats up front, when
the Brutalisk gets to them it can hit them once, you need to back them
out in between using Raynor to hit the Brutalisk with Grenades or
plasma charges.  If done right, you can do it without losing a unit.
Nearly forgot, the 2nd Protoss Relic is in this room, just behind
the lower right containment tanks, use any unit to pick it up (2/4).

Set a breaching Charge on the door on the north wall and go through.
In the next main room you will find the reactor you need to destroy.
When you destroy the reactor the main objective will be complete and
you will have the last one.

Escaping is tough as you will be hunted by a Hybrid.  On the other
side of the room is another pack of plasma ammo, grab it after you
kill the Dominion troops.

Keep moving and you will find the Chrono Rift Device (R) which slows
enemy units in its blast radius, this is essential when the Hybrid
is chasing you.

In the room after destroying the rubble you will find the Hybrid I have
mentioned, look for the pack of grenades and move on to the south west.

In the next room there is a marker, run onto it and then run away, it
will send a war machine after the Hybrid for you.

Move through the south east hallway.  Use a Chrono Rift if the Hybrid
catches up to you at any point.

There will be some rubble and some Dominion troops behind it, more
importantly there is ammo for the Chrono Rift Device.  Keep moving
and you will hit more rubble, hit it with a grenade and grab the
Restoration Charge as you run by.

There will be some units fighting, ignore them the best you can and
grab the Protoss Relic hiding in the south west corner (3/4).  By now
you surely had to use at least 1 Chrono Rift Charge, but that's okay,
just keep moving.  As you go east there will be a small opening on the
north wall, run in and grab the Chrono Rift Device.  Move back out
and keep moving east.

In the next little bit, its kind of confusing, you just need to run
through any forces you encounter, hopefully some will attack the
Hybrid, but you will lose troops, let them die, don't worry only Raynor
needs to survive.  Use grenades on any rubble you encounter and keep
on running.

You will come around a corner and have the option to go down a ramp
on the south edge, or go west, west is bad, but there is a Relic there
so send a couple units that way to get it, they will be sacrificed for
the greater good (4/4).  Send Raynor and what ever troops you have left
down the ramp and just keep running west.  You will find another
Restoration Charge which will likely save your ass.  After grabbing the
Restoration, just north of it is a pack of grenades, kill any units
on you and get them.  The Hybrid has disappeared for now.  Save.

In the room with all the Zerg crap, ignore it, kill any Zerg units that
come after you using grenades and plasma rounds.  The exit is to the
south east.

After taking the ramp out you will kill a couple Marines and grab a
Chrono Rift Device, and the Hybrid will be on your ass, use a
Chrono Rift Device and move fast.

You will get a message about a transport, run for it, its the final
push and if you make it with even just Raynor, you win.



LD14 - Not So Brutalisk
=======================

Kill the Brutalisk without losing a unit on normal.  The Brutalisk is
found part way into the level and is released by a marker.

The best strategy is to have it focused on Raynor while you have
Raynor blasting it with grenades and plasma rounds.  Keep your troops
against a back wall, Marauders work best, you can chose them right
before the Brutalisk.



LD15 - Lock and Load
====================

Locate all 13 weapon pickups on hard.  This is pretty basic, there are
5 Grenades, 1 Experimental Plasma Gun, 3 Plasma ammo, 4 Chrono Rift 
Devices.  Read LD13 for the locations.

LE01 - Smash and Grab  (mission)
================================

Main Objectives
> Get to the Artifact
Bonus Objectives
> Find Protoss Relics (4 Protoss Research)

Start by building SCV's and setting up your economy.  Build another
Barracks, train and upgrade units and get ready for an easy mission.

Once you scout to the north of your base you will get the bonus
objective.  As the relic is undefended, send a marine to grab it (1/4).

1 Bunker and 1 missile turret is enough to defend your base.

Wait around until you get 8 Marauders then head north of your base
and go west.  This will take you to a small Zerg defense point, kill it
and move south west.  After that go south killing the Protoss cannons,
the 2nd relic is just east of the cannons, send a unit to get it (2/4).

Head back to your base and go east.  Keep building units.  Use your
Marauders to destroy the Protoss Pylons from a safe distance and then
keep pushing east.

After the first bridge there is a Protoss force to the south east, kill
it first and then cross the bridge to the south west for the 3rd relic,
send a unit to pick it up (3/4).

Move up the path going north east and you will be in a Protoss base,
kill the units and cannons, then focus on the Pylons so they can not get
any reinforcements.  The fourth relic is down a narrow path in the
upper east corner of the base, send a unit to grab it (4/4).

Ignore the Protoss structures and go up to the marker.  Once you hit
the marker, kill 1 stone guardian at a time and the mission will be
complete.



LE02 - Rock Solid
=================

Complete the mission without losing a unit to the stone guardians.  This
is fairly easy, all you need to do is put a unit on the marker with
all your units around one of the guardians to the far left or right,
then focus fire on that guardian, then the middle, then the opposite
guardian.

Just have plenty of medics and Marauders



LE03 - Hit & Run
================

Complete the mission in under 15 minutes on hard difficulty.  You need
about 10 marauders, 6 marines and 8 medics to beat it with the bare
minimum, this can be done in about 8 minutes.

But of course, the more you have, the easier it will be.  I recommend
16 Marauders, 8 marines and 12 medics, with level 1 attack and defense
upgrades.





LE04 - The Dig  (mission)
=========================

Main Objectives
> Recover the Laser Drill
> Destroy the Xel'Naga Temple Door
> The Laser Drill Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Find Protoss Relics (3 Protoss Research)

Once you have your starting units and the drop ship flies off, move
south and kill the Protoss units.  Keep moving along the path and you
will get some Siege tanks.  Just keep following the path until you make
it to the abandoned Terran base.

Set up your economy, get gas as quick as you can as you will be needing
a lot for the Siege Tanks you will be building.  Train SCV's and start
building Siege Tanks.  Don't forget Supply Depots and to upgrade your
vehicle weapons.

Set up Siege Tanks on the high ground beside either ramp on the east
north entrances to your base.  Build a bunker at the top of both ramps
and build missile turrets along the edge between the Laser Drill and
your defense points.

Just focus on your defense until you get the bonus objective for the
Protoss Relics.

Once you have the bonus objective, set up a small offensive force,
consisting of a couple Siege Tanks, a few marines and medics and get
ready to move out.

The first one is to the north west of your base, wait until any
Protoss forces have attacked from that direction and then move out.
Kill the Protoss and then use the Laser Drill to destroy the Shrine,
once the relic is exposed, send a unit to collect it (1/3)

The next 2 are to the south east of your base, you can do both at the
same time.  Send your offensive force out and kill the Protoss units,
use the Laser Drill to destroy the first Shrine.  While the drill is
burning it to the ground, use your units to move up to the next shrine.
Once the first shrine is down, start attacking the next shrine with
the Laser Drill.  Send a unit to collect the 2nd relic (2/3) and then
once the last shrine is done, send a unit to pick the relic up (3/3).

Just hold out until the Xel'Naga Temple Door is destroyed and the
mission is complete.



LE05 - Drill Hard
=================

Kill 20 units with the Laser Drill on normal.  This is very easy to do,
once you gain control of it, use the shift command to attack any strong
Protoss units, such as Archons or air units.



LE06 - Yippee-ki-yay...
=======================

Kill 50 Protoss structures on hard.  This is actually kind of hard,
you will need lots of Siege Tanks and the Laser Drill to do it.  But
once you break through the initial defenses of the Protoss bases, things
get much easier.

You will need a very strong defense and offense, so take advantage of
the expansion to the south east of your base.

Also, if you build your defense right, you can set up just 1 central
area with Siege Tanks near the Laser Drill and use a bunker on either
side to allow for a larger offensive force.

Don't forget to use the Laser Drill defensively and offensively.

You can fly a Barracks near the enemy base and use the Laser Drill to
destroy Protoss structures.  At the base north of yours the enemy will
rebuild destroyed structures, allowing you to slowly, but eventually
kill enough buildings.



LE07 - The Moebius Factor  (mission)
====================================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Data Cores (3)
> Kerrigan Must Not Access a Data Core
Bonus Objectives
> Kill the Brutalisk (3 Zerg Research)

Start by getting more SCV's and setting up a positive economy.  Train
Siege Tanks and other powerful units quickly, and don't forget to
upgrade your attack and defense.  Again, don't forget Supply Depots.

As soon as you get the 4 extra Marines and the 2 Medivacs, load up and
go south west to the map marker, pick up the units there and destroy
the first Data Core (1/3).

Once the first Data Core is destroyed you need to get back to your
base and then begin taking out the Zerg force outside your base.  Use
a Siege Tank and your Marines to do this and keep building up an
offensive force and getting a solid defense up.

Once you have a good set up, go rescue the 2nd group of survivors to
the west of your base and then fly your drop ships north west of the
2nd group, there is a small corner south west of the 2nd Data Core,
there is another group of survivors here, drop your units and move in
and take out the Data Core.

Once the Data Core is destroyed, move down the ramp and clear the
small area there.  Load into your Medivac's and fly south, drop your
units and kill the Brutalisk.  Once its dead load your troops back up
and fly back to that small zone you clear and unload.

Then go by ground along the path to the next Data Core.  On the way
when you see "alive inside" rescue the last of the survivors and keep
moving.

Once you get to the Data Core, you can basically focus fire on it and
kill it, once its destroyed you win.



LE08 - Alive Inside
===================

Locate all the Moebius survivors on normal.  There are 5 groups.  All
the groups are on ledges and marked with a H and in 1 case, "Alive
Inside".

The first group is south west of your base.

The second group is west of your base.

The third group is north west of the second group.

The fourth group is south west of the 3rd, they are marked with "Alive
Inside".

The fifth group is north of the fourth.



LE09 - Hard Core
================

Complete the mission before Kerrigan destroys 6 abandoned structures
on hard.  This is actually tough, you need a fast force of Siege Tanks
and drop ships.  Any additional units you can bring along, such as
mercenaries and Goliaths will help you greatly.  You only have about
15-17 minutes to do this.  see LE07 for more strategies.





LE10 - Supernova  (mission)
===========================

Main Objectives
> Clear the Landing Zone
> Destroy the Artifact Vault
Bonus Objectives
> Find the Protoss Relics (4 Protoss Research)

When you start use your Banshees, cloak them and kill your way to the
landing zone.  Once the few Protoss units are gone, you will get a
base.  You can come at the Pylon from the side and not have to be
hit by the cannons, though the Stalker will be able to attack you.

Once you have your base, get mining and building more Banshees.  You
do not need to worry about Supply Depots, so build build build.  Get a
couple medics and use the ground troops as defense, don't bother with
Bunkers as you may just have to destroy them anyway.

Use your starting Banshees to move north west and destroy what you can
of the Protoss base.  Destroying it will limit the early attacks on
your base.

When you've done some damage head back to your base.  Take a small
force out and east, just outside your base is a Protoss Relic, grab it
with a ground unit (1/4).

Follow the path south and you will find your next location for your
base when it comes time to move on.  Go east from here to find
another relic, grab it with a ground unit (2/4).

Regroup at your base and send a couple SCV's to where the 2nd relic
was, build armories and engineering bays here, you will have time to
get upgrades before the wall of fire hits it.

Go north east from the entrance of your base, you will encounter some
Protoss forces.  To the east of those forces is a Protoss base, this
will be your first major challenge, ignore it for now.  Keep fighting
north and you will find another Relic, grab it (3/4).  Keep going
north and east and you will find some minerals with a Protoss force,
kill the Protoss and go back to your base.

By now the fire wall should be getting close to you and your minerals
depleted, fly your base east and start mining there.  Get a good
offensive force as you will be taking on the Protoss base next.

Take your time, you are not rushed, mine out the minerals at the 2nd
location and then fly to the location far to the north.  While you are
mining out that location, make your attack on the Protoss base.

Once you have the Protoss base, you need to build a lot of Vikings,
you are going to run into a heavy anti air force in the next large
push.  For now though, begin clearing out the area around your new
base.

I am not sure, but I think the 4th Protoss Relic has a random spot,
there is a location north east of your conquered Protoss base, and a
spot along the path we will be taking to the vault.  Check the first
location just to be sure (it may only be there on lower difficulties).

Once the fire wall is about to overwhelm your base, lift off and move
east, then from there go south, you will find a ramp up into the
Protoss base.  Use everything you have to bust in and take out this
first fortification.

After destroying this fortification, the path up the north east has a
detour to the east, the last relic is there, watch out for the
Templar who may blast you with lighting, then grab the relic (4/4).

Now move into the main Protoss base and begin the assault to get to
the vault.  Just work your way to the Vault and destroy it.



LE11 - Cool Running
===================

Complete the mission without losing a unit to the wall of fire on
normal.  While its easy to not lose a unit, what you need to also do
is destroy any of your own buildings that can not fly away.  If you
don't kill your own buildings you won't be able to get this achievement.



LE12 - Shock 'n' Awe
====================

Kill 75 units and/or structures with Banshees on hard.  This will likely
happen without you needing to try as using cloaked banshees is key to
winning this mission.  Just keep attacking with cloaked banshees and
you will get it.



LE13 - Maw of the Void  (mission)
=================================

Main Objectives
> Clear the Landing Zone
> Destroy the Xel'Naga Vault
Bonus Objectives
> Rescue Prisoners (4 Protoss Research)

Move in with your Battlecruisers and kill the Stalkers, then use the
Yamato Cannon on all 3 Battlecruisers to destroy the Rip-Field
Generator.

When you have a base, get plenty of SCV's out and then set up a solid
defense using a couple Siege Tanks, a bunker and Missile Turrets.

Use your Battlecruisers to clear the low ground around your base and
then collect the resource pallets with an SCV or another ground unit.

Hold out until you're ready to move on and get your expansion.

Move west, destroy the Protoss and the Rip-Field Generator, keep
killing the Protoss and set up your base once your original runs out
of minerals.

To the far south of this new base is a Protoss prison, go destroy it
to get your first set of Dark Templar's (1/4).  Use the Dark Templar's
to take out some of the Protoss then use your Battlecruisers to
take out the next prison (2/4).

Regroup if you need to and then take out the middle Rip-Field
Generator.  Keep building Battlecruisers, by now you should have 12
with level 2 upgrades.

Keep using your Dark Templar's to work slowly at the Protoss and
scout out what you need to hit with your Battlecruisers.  Be cautious
though as there will be detectors shortly.

Your next target will be the Rip-Field Generator along the south side
of the map near the middle.  Once its take out, move west and hit the
next prison (3/4).

Your next move is to hit the last prison (4/4).  Next immediately take
out the Rip-Field Generator to the south west.

Get ready for the next run, you will be going after the northern most
Rip-Field Generator.  Once its destroyed, fall back and go around to
do the same to the southern Generator.

Once its destroyed move north and take out the last one, from here you
can just Yamato the hell out of the vault and win.



LE14 - I Have the Power
=======================

Destroy all the Rip-Field Generators on normal.  They are marked on your
mini-map, destroy them all, its that simple.



LE15 - Master of the Universe
=============================

Do not loose a unit to the Rip-Field on hard.  This is not that hard,
Utilize Battlecruisers and the Dark Templar's (who can't be harmed by
the Rip-Field as long as they have shields).

Do hit and run tactics, take your time, you're not rushed.

LF01 - Whispers of Doom  (mission)
==================================

Main Objectives
> Bring Zeratul to each Xel'Naga Shrine (3 Protoss Research)
> Zeratul Must Survive
Bonus Objectives
> Destroy Zerg Hatcheries (3 Zerg Research)

Once the mission starts follow the path and learn Zeratul's blink
ability.  Blink across the first gap, follow the path and blink
across the 2nd gap.  Both are marked.  Keep going and then destroy
the rubble.  When you get to the first detector you get the Void
Prison ability, use it on the detector and then kill it.

Keep moving forward.  When you go up the ramp and find the next
detector, blink to it and then Void Prison on it, kill it and then
clear the Zerg units.

The next detector is across a gap, Void Prison it and then blink
across and destroy it, clear the Zerg units and move on.

At the next detector, you can hit it with the Void Prison from across
the gap again, do it and then blink across and kill the Hyrdalisks.
Then move forward to the marker and you will have the first shrine
done (1/3).

Go through the newly opened path.  When you blink across the next gap
you will get some Stalkers, they too can blink.  Do your best to keep
them alive.  Blink across the next gap and keep going.

Void Prison the Overseer and blink down with Zeratul to kill the
Hydralisks.  Then keep moving on.  Next drag the Ultralisk back with
one of your Stalkers and when it is safely away from the rest of the
Zerg, Void Prison and kill it.

Now move in with Zeratul and Void Prison the Spine Crawler and kill it
with him.  Now bring in your Stalkers and kill the Mutalisks.  Move
through and then at the next spot go slowly.

You need to wait for the top of the 2 Guardians to be closest to the
ramp, when it is, Void Prison it and blink your Stalkers in to kill it
and then get them out of there.  Next Void Prison the 2nd Guardian
and use the Stalkers to kill it.

Then from a safe distance kill the Overseer with your Stalkers and
then use Zeratul to Void Prison the Spore Crawler and kill it, then
the Spine Crawler.  Blink across the next gap.

When you are warned to brace for an aerial attack you need to Void
Prison the Ultralisk that unburrows nearby.  Once the attack is
over you have a new path to blink to where a new Stalker is.  You will
get the bonus objective here.

On the upper edge go to the north with Zeratul, you can use Void
Prison when the closet Overseer is nearly above the edge, then kill it
with the Stalkers, this will likely draw out the Guardian,
blink any Stalkers being damaged out and when you can Void Prison
the Guardian and kill it.  If you didn't draw the Guardian out, just
try again by attacking it with a Stalker.

Now bring your Stalkers along the northern most corner, use Void Prison
on the Overseer and kill it, then kill the Mutalisks if you have not
already, though do this safely out of the reach of the Spine Crawlers.
Just blink Zeratul down and kill the Spine Crawlers, and then have the
Stalkers join him, once the hatchery is destroyed move on (1/3).

You will now be at the second shrine (2/3).  Once the speech is over
move through the path.  Use your Stalkers to draw the Guardian and
Mutalisks out as slowly as possible, use Void Prison on the Guardian.
Once they are dead kill the Overseer and use Zeratul to kill the
Spine Crawlers.  Use caution as an Ultralisk waits for you.

When the Banelings come after you just simple hit and run, fall all
the way back to where the Hatchery was.  Go back to where the Banelings
originated from and finish them off.

Go south and the path will collapse, blink across.  Bring Zeratul in
close to the Hatchery, but out of the vision of the detectors.  Now
bring in 2 Stalkers and keep them out of range of the Spine crawler,
but close enough that they can attack the Overseer.  Make sure Zeratul
is on hold, when an Ultralisk pops up, blink the Stalkers to safety
and then use Void Prison on the Ultralisk and kill it.  Finish off
the Overseer if its not already dead.  Then blink Zeratul in and Void
Prison the Spore Crawler, then kill the Spine Crawler and Hatchery.
You do not need your Stalkers, you may as well blink them back across
the gap (2/3).

Move along the path to the north now.  Hold your Stalkers on the
high ground, move Zeratul in and drag what you can back to your
Stalkers.  Then move in with Zeratul and kill anything that is left,
or drag them back again, or bring your whole force in.

Now go quickly up the ramp and kill as many Spine Crawlers as you can.
If you didn't get them all, no worries, Void Prison the Overseer and
use Zeratul to kill them, then bring your Stalkers in.

Move on and destroy the rubble, you will then get a cut scene  use
void Prison on the Ultralisk and move in.  Kill the air units with
your Stalkers, then use Zeratul to kill the Nydus Worms.  Once the
battle is over, move your force onto the high ground and blink
across the path to the other side on the high ground.

Blink across the gap and destroy the rubble.  Stay along the south edge
and you will find the last Hatchery.  Place Zeratul in the middle of
the bottom of the ramp, just outside the vision of the detectors.
Place your Stalkers on hold further back.  Take one Stalker up and
shoot a Roach once, and run away.  This will draw the Roaches right
past Zeratul.  Repeat.  Void Prison the Spine Crawler and kill it,
then move in and finish the rest off (3/3).

From where the Hatchery was blink down and make your way to the
final shrine (3/3).

After the cut scene, run as fast as you can, hold off on blinking
until you hit the first rubble, blink to the other side.  Keep going
and you will hit some more rubble, blink past and attack the next pile
of rubble, run up the ramp and blink to the marker.



LF02 - Stalker Delight
======================

Complete the mission with 3 or more Stalkers on normal.  Just as it
says, use save points, if too many die, go back a save point and try
again.



LF03 - Merely a Flesh Wound
===========================

Complete the mission without Zeratul taking life damage on hard.  This
does not mean he can't take damage, he just can't lose life, his
shields have to hold up.  Use save points and be careful.



LF04 - A Sinister Turn  (mission)
=================================

Main Objectives
> Power-up the Abandoned Base
> Free the Preservers (3 Zerg Research)
Bonus Objectives
> Power-up Abandoned Structures (3 Protoss Research)

Build probes and 2 Pylons in the marked spots.  Build Stalkers and
get some more Photon Cannons, upgrade your units and keep building
more probes.

As soon as you have defended the first Hybrid attack, send a couple
Stalkers to the Robotics Facility to the west, build a Pylon there so
you can build some Immortals (1/3).

Keep building Stalkers as well.  Next go east and clear the Dark
Shrine, build a Pylon to activate it and start building Dark Templar's
(2/3).

Once you have about 3 Immortals, 14 Stalkers and 4 Dark Templar's as
an offensive force, move to the 3rd map marker and take out the
Protoss base there. Once cleared build a Pylon near the Templar
Archives so you can build Templar's (3/3).

As long as you didn't lose to many troops, move in and destroy
the Protoss base and free the Preservers, destroy each Preserver's
prison to free the Preserver (1/3) (2/3) (3/3).



LF05 - Out for Justice
======================

Kill all Protoss on normal.  As simple as it says, just keep killing
until there is no Protoss left.



LF06 - Maar-ked for Death
=========================

Complete the mission in under 25 minutes on hard.  Can be hard, you
need a strong force of Dark Templar's and Stalkers.  Have a few
Immortals in your base for defense against the Hybrid.  Basically
just follow the strategy in LF04, just move really quick.





LF07 - Echoes of the Future  (mission)
======================================

Main Objectives
> Reach the Nexus
> Zeratul Must Survive
> Bring Zeratul to the Overmind Tendrils (4 Zerg Research)
Bonus Objectives
> Power the Obelisks (2 Protoss Research)

Use Zeratul to move forward killing all the Zerg units, burrowed or
not.  Bring Zeratul to the marker.

Once you have your base, build at least 4 Pylons to activate
everything in the base, set the Colossus units between the 2 groups
of Photon Cannons for defense.  Once the Pylons are warped in,
build more probes and get your economy going.

While that's happening, use Zeratul to go north and start killing
the Zerg, use an observer to see burrowed units.

Build up your defense.  Train an offensive force.  Upgrade.

Clear the high ground north of your base and you will get the bonus
objective, when you can send a probe and build a Pylon (1/2).

Next clear the high ground north east of your base, you will need a
small army and Zeratul to do this, when its clear you can send Zeratul
to the marker (1/4) and then build a Pylon by the Obelisk (2/2).

Now move east.  Fight your way to the lowest of the 3 remaining
markers.  When you get there throw Zeratul on it (2/4).

Now move north and fight your way to the marker on the east side.
When you get there, send Zeratul onto the marker (3/4).

Keep moving west until the next marker. Fight until you get to the
marker and send Zeratul onto it (4/4).



LF08 - Army of One
==================

Kill 50 Zerg units with Zeratul on normal.  This is so easy to do,
you probably will get it without trying.



LF09 - Overmind Dead Body
=========================

Complete the mission in under 20 minutes on hard.  Just read LF07
and go fast while doing it, it isn't very hard.





LF10 - In Utter Darkness  (mission)
===================================

Main Objectives
> Kill 2000 Enemy Forces
> Defend Until the Last Protoss Falls
Bonus Objectives
> Protect the Protoss Archive (3 Protoss Research)

This is a really cool mission, there are 2 important things to do at
the start, get more probes and get the expansion.  Also very important
is to get working on the unit upgrades, you will need level 3 on all
to have the best chance of surviving.

The first thing you need to do is send a Probe to the north west
corner and build a base.  Get your Nexus building Probes and sending
them up there.  Be ready to defend it early, then after that it
will be fine on its own until it runs out of minerals, if you can save
it and keep mining gas, that's great.

Also make sure you have 2-3 Probes per mineral deposit at your main
base.  Build 2 addition Forges, and a Cybernetics Core.  Get your
upgrades going and start training some units.  Save your money and
be ready to train a lot of the most powerful units, such as Carriers
and Colossus's

Just defend for as long as you can on the low ground, while building
massive amounts of cannons on the high ground.

There is no real way to guide you step by step through this mission
as its all a matter of just surviving.

One of the most important abilities is the Graviton Beam.  Also if
you use Vortex properly you can really save yourself.

If you can protect the archive for the 20 minutes, you will get the
bonus objective completed.

Mass Colossus, Immortals and Carriers.



LF11 - Semi-Glorious
====================

Kill 250 extra units on normal.  Have a good defense.



LF12 - Blaze of Glory
=====================

Kill 750 extra units on hard.  Have a superior defense and utilize all
abilities and units available.

LG01 - Gates of Hell  (mission)
===============================

Main Objectives
> Gather a Large Army
> Destroy the Nydus Worms (3)

Its a good idea to just use the starting forces you have, and just build
SCV's and get your upgrades going.  Your army will grow as you rescue
the Dominion Troops.

Build as many defensive structures as you can, create choke points
with structures and have SCV's to repair them.

The Dominion troops that get dropped in will be marked on your map,
just pay attention and send what units you can spare to rescue them.

The first couple Drop-Pods you can use a Marine to drag the Zerg
units between you and the Dominion Troops, back to your Siege Tanks.

Keep building up and rescuing the Dominion forces.  If you do happen
to gather a Large Army before all the Drop-Pods have come down, that's
perfectly alright.

Once you do complete that objective you will get the 2nd main objective.

Warfield will be pinned down and I honestly have no idea if his base
will ever get over run by the Zerg, I could never play long enough to
find out and I don't feel like sitting there for hours to find out.  So
play at your own pace and you should be fine.

Just use all the units you can spare and head east and then south
east, follow the path all the way to Warfields base.  The more you kill
as you go, the less you will get hit from behind.

Once you get to the Nydus Worms kill them to complete the mission.



LG02 - The Big Bang Cannon
==========================

Destroy all the Spore Cannons on normal.  There are X.

The first one is north west of your base, take the north exit from
your base to find it.

The second one is north east of your base, take the east exit and go
north to find it.

The third one is south west of your base, take the west exit and go
south to find it.

The fourth one is just simply east of your base.

The fifth one is south of the fourth one.

The sixth is south east of your base, its actually in the resource
expansion area.



LG03 - Dominion Roundup
=======================

Rescue 10 Drop-Pods on hard.  This means all of them, if you miss one
load a save point and try again.  Each time a Drop-Pod comes down it
will be marked on your map, get some troops to the locations as quick
as you can.

When you have 4 Drop-Pods remaining, you will get 2 at once, you need
to separate your forces.  I would use a couple fast units such as
Vultures to lure the south Zerg units back to your defensive point,
while the bulk of your army heads north.  Once the southern forces
have been wiped out, send a couple of your fastest units to run past
any Zerg forces that are left and rescue the units in the south.  If
you do it right you will get both no problem.

The next 2 Drop-Pods are just as easy, use another unit to lure the
western Zerg forces to your base and then go rescue the Dominion
troops while the bulk of your force goes north of your base.





LG04 - Belly of the Beast  (mission)
====================================

Main Objectives
> Plant Seismic Charges at each Fissure (3)
> Run to The Extraction Point

You command 4 heroes and you don't have to build anything.  Learn
their abilities as you go and use them as often as you can.  They all
use (T) as the hotkey.

The first thing to learn is the Penetrator Round, nearly as soon as you
start, you can kill the whole line in 1 shot.

Keep moving forward, at the next group use the Penetrator Round again
to kill the Spine Crawlers at the same time.

Keep moving forward and Tychus will get grenades.  Take out the group
of Zerg and keep pushing forward.

At the next group with the 2 Spine Crawlers, use a grenade and a
penetrator round to do as much damage as you can, mop up what ever is
left and move forward.

Moving on and you will learn the Flaming Betty ability.  Don't forget
to use a penetrator round.  Then move on.

You will have the opportunity to move north and rescue some Marines
and a Medic, go ahead and get em, use a grenade and penetrator round
to take out the Zerg and even a Flaming Betty if you want.  After you
have the additional troops move south, destroy the rubble and keep
going.

As you move around a bend Zerg units will unburrow, use a Penetrator
Round to take em out, immediately behind you there will be some more,
use a grenade to kill them.  Move on and use a Flaming Betty.

As you move west some Nydus Worms will pop up, use your abilities to
take them out quickly.  Keep moving and you will find a marker, step
onto it and get ready to defend the first Seismic Charge.

Place a Flaming Betty at one of the 3 choke points and fight it out.
Use your abilities as much as possible.  After the timer runs out you
will be in a new zone (1/3).

Move east and use a Grenade on those Infested Terran units.  Now move
south, kill some more infested units and then on the creep to the south
west you will need to use a penetrator round and a grenade.  It may
look like a good spot to get the 50 kills in 1 shot, but its not,
just clear it out and move on.

As you start heading east you will come to some red crystals, save here
if you want to complete the "One Shot, Fifty Kills" achievement.

OSFK

Keep your units back, but keep Egon Stetmann near the west side of
the red crystals and tell him to hold.  Take Raynor along the south path
until you can see the Zerg units.  Dance around making them chase you
in a group, the Spine Crawlers will attack Raynor, after the first
hits from them on Raynor, fall back out of their range and then aim
the penetrator round just north of the Spine Crawlers.  If you did it
all right, you will get the achievement.

Finish off the rest of the Zerg with all your units now, and as always
keep moving forward, even if that's south.  Around a corner are some
Banelings, use all your abilities to keep them dead and away from you.

As you're moving east along the path you will get a transmission for a
rescue, lay down a Flaming Betty to cover your rear and move forward.

Clean out the area.  Move east and rescue the Firebats and Medic.  Move
north, use your abilities to take out the Nydus Worms and the Flaming
Betty to cover your flank.

Once you get to the marker, jump on it and defend that Seismic Charge.
Use all your abilities to take on the Zerg, near the last 30 seconds a
couple Ultralisks will come at you, use the grenade and penetrator
round abilities to take them out.  Once the count down timer is done
you will be in a new area (2/3).

Move west, taking everything out as you go.  Follow the path and as
you go north, keep taking everything out as you go.  When you get the
transmission for another rescue, use your abilities as soon as you
can on the Omegalisk.  If you do it right you will rescue the Marines
safely.

When you step on the marker you will be defending the last charge,
and also fighting a Zerg Queen.  Its very easy, just use your abilities
on it to kill it.  After the 3rd time it burrows, you need to be ready
near the Seismic Charge, when it comes back it does a stun attack.

Just use your abilities and focus fire on it, as soon as it dies you
move on to the last part of the mission (3/3).

Just run ignore most things, use grenades on the first group of Zerg
units and a penetrator shot on the 2 Spine Crawlers.  Keep going and
placing Flaming Betty down behind you to cover your rear.  Just keep
going and you will make it to the last marker and beat the mission.



LG05 - Unbreakable
==================

Complete the mission without one of your heroes getting incapacitated
on normal.  This can be done simply by using save points and trying
the hard parts again until you get it right.



LG06 - One Shot, Fifty Kills
============================

Kill 50 units with a single Penetrator Round on hard.  Find the code
OSFK in the LG04 walkthrough to find out how to accomplish this one.





LG07 - Shatter the Sky  (mission)
=================================

Main Objectives
> Destroy the Coolant Towers (4)
Bonus Objectives
> Kill the Zerg Leviathan

Start by getting your economy going, train SCV's and getting your base
prepared for producing Thor, Battlecruiser and a mix of other units of
your preference, also have Vikings or Wraiths.

Set up a small defense that can cover both entrance to your base,
utilize a couple Siege Tanks and bunkers, build a few extra Missile
Turrets as its an air level.

Once your defense is set up, use your attack force to go out the west
exit of your base and fight your way to the Coolant Tower and
destroy it.  Get your units off the platform once its dead (1/4).

Mass up Battlecruisers as their special attack can quickly take out
the Coolant Towers, 5 will do it.

Make your way to the north west tower next.  Fight your way in and
as fast as you can kill the tower and run (2/4).

If you feel like expanding, kill the Zerg base to the south of your
base.  You will also get the bonus objective, its not easy to kill, use
your Yamato Guns on it and hit it with everything you got and you will
still loose a lot of unit.  Having 8 Battlecruisers and 4 Thors, about
12 Wraiths or Vikings will just barely kill the beast.

After the Leviathan, move on to the south west tower.  Again, just
fight in to the tower and then kill it and run (3/4).

Now move on to the last tower, having additional Thors here will help
out, fight in, kill the tower and run (4/4).



LG08 - Demolition Man
=====================

Complete the mission without losing a unit to the platform explosions
on normal.  This should be so obvious you don't need to be told what
to do.



LG09 - Speed Too!
=================

Complete the mission in under 25 minutes on hard.  Relatively easy, just
follow the strategy in LG07 and you should do it without having to rush
hard.  Though I would skip the Leviathan.  And also you can just use
Yamato Guns to kill the tower and run without having to kill anything
on the platform.



LG10 - All In  (mission)
========================

Main Objectives
> Defend the Artifact

You start with a lot of SCV's, build more.  Get your upgrades going
and build the best defense you've ever built.  This is a fairly hard
mission, especially when accomplishing the Aces High achievement.

Right away get some troops into the bunkers at the 2 main entrances to
your base, you should build at least 2 more, and have at least 4 Siege
Tanks at each side, with a couple more up on the high ground.

You will also need Missile Turrets throughout your base, as you will
have to deal with an Overlord drop attack.

When Kerrigan attacks, your best defense is to either use the artifact
and/or Yamato Cannons.

Build a mobile defense force and have fun.  You need to keep building
and rebuilding, especially after Kerrigan comes and works you over.

There are 2 versions of this map and they are both the exact same,
with the one difference, you will either have Nydus Worms sending out
attack waves of ground units, or you will have air unit after air
unit attacking you.

Nydus Worm strategy: have 2 groups of 8 Battlecruisers (starting with
just one group that grows into 2), when ever Nydus Worms pop up, send
them out targeting only the Nydus Worms, with the final shift command
being back to your base.  You can even use a 3rd smaller group to take
out the closet ones while the other 2 groups split up the further
targets.

Air strategy: have 2 groups of Wraiths and/or Vikings, keep them
near your 2 defense points and take out the air as it comes at you.
Basically you only need to really worry about the Guardians as they
stay out of range of your Missile Turrets.  Keep some SCV's scattered
around with your Missile Turrets for repairs.

Useful tips: have about 3-5 SCV's for repairs at both entrances as
well as Medics to heal your SCV's, you can never have enough Missile
Turrets or Siege Tanks or your favorite units what ever they may be,
build extra Barracks and Factories and Starports, upgrade to level 3
weapons and armor on all your units.



LG11 - Burn and Turn
====================

Kill 150 Zerg units with the artifact on normal.  This is very easy,
just use it any time there is a lot of Zerg units, especially when
Kerrigan is attacking.



LG12 - Aces High
================

Use the artifact only once on hard.  This conflicts with the Burn and
Turn achievement, so I recommend completing this achievement entirely
on its own.  If you even need to use it, do so only in the last 7%
during the Zerg's final desperate push against you.

Just for the record, this was the only achievement I couldn't earn
with no upgrades or mercenaries, on either version of the map, but
especially the anti-air map.

You do not need to complete all achievements to earn this achievement.





LH04 - Zeratul Missions
=======================

These missions are all found in the Laboratory and are:
Whispers of Doom, A Sinister Turn, Echoes of the Future and In Utter
Darkness

You do not need to complete all achievements to earn this achievement.





LH05 - Ihan Crystal
===================

You receive this after the mission "The Dig".





LH06 - Stay Awhile and Listen
=============================

For this one you need to talk to the main characters while they are
available on the Wings of Liberty and for Horace Warfield, during the
final missions.  Talking to them is simply clicking on them, you don't
have to talk to them after every mission and you don't have to actually
listen to them.





LH07 - Couch Surfer (portrait)
==============================

For this one you need to watch the news from the Cantina 10 times.  You
don't actually have to watch the whole thing, just clicking on the TV
after 10 different missions is enough.





LH08 - Nice Suit
================

To get this one, you need to talk to Tychus after the "Zero Hour"
mission and you can't hit Escape, you can just keep clicking to skip
through the talking though.





LH09 - Dead Man's Hand
======================

To get this one, you need to talk to Matt after completing "The Great
Train Robbery" mission and you can't hit escape, you can just keep
clicking to skip through the talking though.





LH10 - Terra-tron Terrorized!
=============================

The arcade machine in the Cantina is where you can play this mini-game.

There are 3 levels, the Terra-tron is the boss of the 3rd level, beat
him to complete this achievement.

See the next achievement (LH11) for strategies.





LH11 - Lost Viking x3
=====================
1 - 125,000 points
2 - 250,000 points
3 - 500,000 points

After beating the Terra-tron you will be able to play through again on a
harder difficulty.  To earn this achievement you will need to beat all 3
levels 3 times in a row without getting game over.

There are 4 power ups, you can see them at the start of the game, you
can move around before pressing "begin" and check them out.  You are
only able to have 1 of the 2 weapon upgrades and 2 of the drone upgrades
at any given time, though you still get points for grabbing them.  You
can have as many bombs as you can get (as far as I know, I've had 15).

Which weapon you go with is up to you.  The purple single shot is very
powerful and excellent at taking out large enemies and bosses, though
you pretty much have to have 2 drones at all times.  While the spread
shot is very effective at taking out large groups of enemies, it takes a
lot longer to kill bosses.  My preferences is the spread shot because it
is easier to earn points and the bosses are easy any way.  Drones will
absorb 1 killing shot each, effectively they are like a bonus life.

Upgrades cycle from one to another every 20 seconds or so, if you see
an upgrade you don't need or want, let it cycle to something you do
want, eventually you will just be getting bomb after bomb.  The cycle
is Bomb - Side Missiles - Drone - Plasma Missile - Bomb - etc.  Upgrades
will only cycle through once and then stop flying with you and will
fall behind.

Don't hold space, press it repeatedly for a faster attack.

You will only learn the levels by playing them, they never change
and are short enough for you to memorize.

There is no bonus for getting 100%.

If you are about to get hit use a bomb, you will destroy any normal
units and missiles on the screen and become invulnerable for 2 seconds.

Don't hesitate to use bombs!  Better to use a bomb than lose a drone,
or 2 drones, or a life.



Life 1 = 25,000
Life 2 = 75,000
Life 3 = 125,000
Life 4 = 250,000
Life 5 = 375,000
Life 6 = 525,000
Life 7 = ?



Level 1 (4,7,10,etc):
After about 3 waves of Scouts you will get the first upgrade, it will
be the spread shot get it.  The second upgrade comes shortly after,
make sure you get a drone now.  The next upgrade is almost immediately
after the 2nd, get another spreadshot.  The 4th upgrade is not far
after the 3rd, get a second spreadshot.  Now when ever an upgrade
appears, grab a bomb, though if a drone takes a hit, obviously get a
new drone.

Boss - Carrier: simple enough, focus on the carrier at all times,
allow your side missiles to kill the Interceptors.  When it does its
charge attack sit right in front of it until its attack is coming
right for you, then just slowly move to the left or right, in a kind of
jump a short distance at a time maneuver, or slow motion if you will.
Choose which ever side has more room.  Just repeat until the boss is
dead.

Scouts = 127  (100%)
Phoenix = 14  (100%)
Interceptors = 40+ (100% depends on how long it takes to kill the boss)
Carrier = 1  (100%)

Power-ups = 5  (100%)



Level 2 (5,8,11,etc):
If you have any problems with dodging enemy projectiles, you may want
to consider using the Plasma Cannon as the Scourge death projectiles
will be less random and easier to dodge.

Also for most of this level, just hold the spacebar rather than rapidly
press the space button, this will save your wrist muscles from doing
more work than they need to.

When you fight the mini bosses, the Swarm Guardians, focus on one at a
time, there will be 2 groups of 2 Swarm Guardians.  Then you will be
at the boss shortly.

If you played perfectly so far you will have 2 spreadshots, 2 drones
and 13 bombs.  You will also have 5 lives.

Boss - Leviathan: I find this to be the easiest boss of the 3, just
keep shooting it, watch for its tentacle attacks and just move at
extremes to avoid getting hit.

Scourge = 434  (100%)
Corrupter = 13  (100%)
Guardian = 4  (100%)
Leviathan = 1  (100%)

Power-ups = 16  (100%)



Level 3 (6,9,12,etc):
You should still have 2 spreadshots and 2 drones, if not, collect what
you need and keep saving up those bombs.  Eventually you will run into
the mini bosses, Battlecruisers.  They have 2 attacks, seeker missiles
that you can shoot down and their laser assault that you can not,
the laser assault only fires directly ahead so its easy to avoid, but
the seeker missiles will hunt you down.  Kill which ever Battlecruiser
is shooting seeker missiles first, then wait till the other stops the
laser assault and starts firing seeker missiles too.

If playing perfectly still, you will have your 2 spreadshots, 2 drones,
26 bombs and 6 lives.

Boss - Terra-tron: by far the most complicated of the 3 bosses, but
still very easy.  This is where you will use most of your bombs, not
for damage, but simply to get rid of his missiles.  Don't hesitate to
use one if you get stuck in a bad place.  As long as you play well,
each time you get to him you should have 10 bombs to use and still
have a couple left over.

The first few seconds you can blast away at him,
then he shoots his orange finger shots, these are very easy to dodge,
sit at the middle of the bottom of the screen, and just move up and
at an angle through them.

Next his hover drones come out, keep sitting in front of him blasting
away.  They shoot red missiles at you, in combination with his laser
beam from the head.  Start from the middle and move all the way
opposite from the head laser, then move up the screen to finish
dodging the missiles on the screen.

He will also shoot multiple waves of the red bullets combined with
the orange finger shots, this one is best dodged slightly to the
left or right of the middle, at the bottom of the screen, just move
forward as the bullets criss-cross.

When he gets his spinning blue disc weapon bouncing around after you,
your best bet is to focus on where the blue disc will be in 2-3 seconds
and be going in the opposite direction, to one of the previous starting
points for dodging the other attacks.

One good general spot for dodging at this point is either side of the
screen, part way up from the bottom.

Just keep wearing him down and dodging, again don't hesitate to use
bombs.

Wraiths = 706  (100%)
Science Vessels = 6  (100%)
Battlecruisers = 2  (100%)
Terra-tron = 1  (100%)

Power-ups 13  (100%)



When you have beat the 3rd level, you can replay the game on a harder
difficulty, this is the only way to get the maximum score.  Not much
changes in the levels, enemies take more damage before being killed
and in the Terran level side laser cannons shoot out, you basically
have to run through the beam to die, if you get very close to one you
won't even lose a drone, but again, avoid it safely.

LH22 - Hurry Up: It's Raid Night
================================

This achievement is really very easy to earn as you only have to
complete essential missions.  You don't even need to rush a whole lot
to do it.  Also you don't have to beat any bonus objectives and you
don't have to complete any additional achievements.

Start a new campaign on normal, play the missions in this order:
LA01 - Liberation Day (2:34)
LA02 - The Outlaws (3:53)
LA03 - Zero Hour (20:12)
LE01 - Smash and Grab (7:37)
LC01 - The Devil's Playground (8:34)

> XD01 - Tactical Command: Gold
===============================

Round 1:
Send the Hellions to the Zergling zone, set them up in a wall
and when one gets into the orange, move it back.  

Send the Siege Tank and the Ghost to the Baneling zone. Set the tank up
high above the Supply Depot, have the Ghost up front, use Sniper
Rounds a lot (R).

Send the Marines to the Mutalisk Zone, place them in a ) shape and
have the Medivacs in front.  The Mutalisks will hit the Medivacs first,
when their health drops move them back.  You need to use Stimpacks
before the Mutalisks get to your Marines, the timing of this is
critical.  Also you can pick up Marines using the Dropships to save
them.

My Units Lost: 0



Round 2:
Send all but 3 of the Marauders and all the Marines to the
Roach zone.  Set the Marauders up in a line, with the Marines in 2
groups behind the line on either end.  Use Stimpacks when the Roaches
get near you.

Send 1 Marauder, the Siege Tank and the Ghost to the Ultralisk zone.
Put the Siege Tank to the furthest point to the north, above the Supply
depot, set the Marauder on hold in front of the Tank and set the
Ghost up as close the Ultralisk as you can.  Use the Sniper Round (R)
as much as you can, and have the Ultralisk chase the Ghost into range
of the Siege Tank.  Cloak the Ghost before it dies and then use the
Marauders Stimpack and have the Ultralisk chase it while the Siege Tank
destroys the Ultralisk.

Send the remaining units to the Hydralisk zone.  Set the Tanks up in a
line in front of the Supply Depot, have the Marauders well in front of
the Siege Tanks, the Medivacs between the Siege Tanks and the Marauders,
you need to use the Stimpacks as soon as you get control in that zone.
When the Marauders life falls, drop them back quickly behind the Siege
Tanks.

My Units Lost: 0


Round 3:
Send the Hellions, the Ghost and 5 Vikings to the Guardian
and Zergling zone.  The Hellions go in 2 lines on either side of the
Supply Depot, but just slightly behind it.  Have the Ghost and the
Vikings as close as possible to the Zerg.  You will need to cloak the
Ghost when you're ready and use Sniper Rounds (R) on the Guardians.
Use the Vikings to target the Guardians 1 at a time.

Send the Siege Tanks, Marauders and Medivacs to the Hydralisk and
Roach zone.  Set the Siege Tanks up in a line and have the Marauders
and Medivacs in front  Bring the Marauders back behind the Siege Tanks
if their health falls low.

Send the Thors and 5 Vikings to the Mutalisk Zone.  Have the Thors
right up to the line and the Vikings above the Supply Depot.  When
the zone starts, use the Vikings to attack one Mutalisk at a time.

My Units Lost: 0





> XD02 - Path of Ascension: Gold
================================

Round 1:
Send your Stalkers to the Hellion zone, place them in a line, when one
gets badly damaged, blink him out of battle.

Send the Colossus's to the Marines, line them up.  When 1 loses its
shields, bring it behind the line, keep rotating like that.

Send the Sentry and the Zealots to the Marauders.  When the zone starts
use 4 Zealot Hallucinations and send them in to the Marauders, and
have the real Zealots follow them in, as soon as the Marauders start
shooting the hallucinations, the Zealots should be moving in to attack.
Have your Real Zealots in 2 lines on either side of the Sentry.
The hotkey for hallucinating Zealots is (C) (Z).  You get 2 Zealots
with each cast of the ability.

My Units Lost: 0



Round 2:
Send your Carriers and High Templar to the Thor zone.  When the zone
starts, use your Carriers to attack one Thor at a time, having them
way back from the Thors and using the shift command to set up the
attack order.  When the Carriers start attacking the Thors, use the
High Templar's Psionic Storm on the largest groups of Thors.  Drop
Carriers back as their health drops, but don't forget to bring them
back into battle as soon as they stop taking damage.

Send your Immortals to the Siege Tank zone.  Set them up in a line,
once the zone starts, move them in, letting the Siege Tanks get into
Siege Mode is actually what you want.  Any Immortals that lose
their shields need to be moved out of range of the tanks.

Send your Void Rays to the Battlecruisers.  Just kill one at a time,
your Void Rays that lose their shields need to drop back and then
come back to battle.

My Units Lost: 0



Round 3:
Send the Archons, Sentry and Phoenix units to the Battlecruiser and
Viking Zone.  Set up 2 Archons on either side of the Pylon, the
Sentry in front of the Pylon and the Phoenix behind the Pylon.  When
the Zone starts, create 2 Archon Hallucinations (C)(N). Send the Archons
and the hallucinations in targeting the vikings, the hallucinations
should be ahead of the real ones so they take the damage.  Send the
Phoenix in once the battle starts to kill the Battlecruiser, the
Vikings should have transformed to ground units before they get there.
Any units that take too much damage, drop back out of battle.

Send the Colossus's and Stalkers to the Hellion and Reaper zone.
Set the Colossus's up in a 3 point < with the Stalkers in the
middle of them and the High Templar near the back.  As your Stalkers
take damage, blink them out.

Send the Zealots, Immortals and High Templar to the Marauder and Siege
Tank zone.  Have the Immortals in a line at the front, with the
Zealots in a group to the bottom of the line on hold, the Templar
should be behind the Immortals.  When the zone starts, use Psionic
Storm on the Marauders and any Immortals that lose shields need to
stay out of battle.

> XD03 - For the Swarm: Gold
============================

Round 1:
Send your Ultralisks to the Colossus zone.  Just have them in a line,
when the zone starts, send them in, any that get into the red, drop
back or burrow.

Send your Infestornd Zerglings to the Immortal.  Burrow the Zerglings
as close to the Immortal as you can, leave the Infestor far back,
when the zone starts use Neural Parasite (E) on the Immortal as it gets
over the Zerglings, once its under your control, use your Zerglings to
kill it.

Send your Hydralisks to the Void Ray Zone.  Have them far back and when
the zone starts, send them on an shift attack commands to kill one at

until you've taken a bit of damage, and then burrow.  Just repeat
this until the Zealots are dead.

Send the Infestor and the Mutalisks to the Void Ray zone.  Have the
Mutalisks back and the Infestor in front, use Neural Parasite (E) on
a Void Ray and then use the Mutalisks to target one Void Ray at a
time.  Remove Mutalisks from battle as they take heavy damage.
Kill the Void Ray if its still alive at the end.

Send your Ultralisks to the stalkers.  If one of them takes a lot of

Zealot zone.  Burrow your Roaches and Infestor together, have the
Guardians ready near the front.  Move your burrowed units in while
the Guardians are attacking the Archons, use Fungal Growth (F) on the
Zealots and then use Neural Parasite (E) on an Archon, keep the
Guardians attacking the Archons and use the Roaches to protect the
Infestor.  Kill the Guardian if it survived.

Send the Corruptors to the Carriers zone.  Target one Carrier at a time
using the shift attack command, and use Corruption on each on as they

My Units Lost: 0





> XD04 - Covert Ops: Gold
=========================

Split your Ravens and Ghosts up into 2 even groups, send one group
east, the other North.  You need to do both groups at the same time,
so thats how I will write it.  You can number your groups before
pressing ready.  It doesn't matter which side the extra Ghost goes to.

East Group.  Use a Seeker Missile (R) on one of the Mutalisks, use
Sniper Rounds (R) on any Mutalisks that don't take damage, then 
attack move the group to where the Zerg was.

North Group.  Use a Seeker Missile on the Roach, as it hits, use
Sniper Rounds on the Hydralisks.  Attack move in to where the
Zerg was.

East Group.  Cloak a Ghost and move past the Zerglings, go east and
nuke the little base.  While the Ghost is on the move, kill the
Zerglings with a Seeker Missile.

North Group.  Send a Ghost to nuke the little base, while the Ghost is
on the way, use a Seeker Missile on the nearby Mutalisks.  Finish
off the rest of the group with your Ghosts.

East Group.  Move your units north, leading with 2 cloaked Ghosts.
At the first group of Zerg with the Spine Crawler, use a Seeker Missile
and then use another on the Mutalisks.  While you're doing this, your
cloaked Ghosts should be moving north, sticking to the wall on
the east side of the pit in the middle.  The Mutalisks will come after
your Raven that Seeker Missiled them, draw them back to your Ghosts.
Use a cloaked Ghost to go near the east side of the ramp into the
pit, nuke the pit.  Use the other to nuke the group of Zerg on the
far east wall.

North Group.  Move a Raven forward and use a Seeker Missile to
kill the Zerglings, while at the exact same time, send a cloaked
Ghost in and Nuke the Hatchery.

East Group.  Cloak all your Ghosts, move in, Sniper Round and Seeker
Missile the Hyrdralisks by the Spine Crawler beside the ramp to the
little platform on the east wall.  Move up the ramp and Seeker
Missile a Mutalisk and Sniper the rest to death.  Move up and Nuke the
Zerg main base on the low ground.  Don't get to close the edge and
use only 1 nuke.

North Group.  Move through the devastated Zerg base, stick to the west
and Sniper Round the Hydralisks.  Move up the ramp, Seeker Missile the
Roach, and move up the ramp.  Move up the final ramp and use at least
2 Seeker Missiles to take out the Mutalisks.  Move a Ghost in, not to
close to the edge and nuke the Zerg main base on the low ground.

My kills: 223





> XD05 - Psionic Assault: Gold
==============================

I can honestly say, this was the worst of all the Challenges for me.
You need to use Force Fields (F) a lot with your Sentry units.  Save
your High Templar's Psionic Storm (T) sparingly.  also, use units who
have full energy first, this way you maximize energy regeneration.

Wave 1 - easy enough use 3 Force Fields as the Zerglings approach so
they can't get up the ramp and let the Sentries kill them.

Wave 2 - save some energy and let the Marines shoot your Sentries, but
use a Psionic Storm on them, drop Sentries back as they lose shields.

Wave 3 - set up Force Fields to block the ramp and then use Psionic
Storm to hit the Zerglings and Hydralisks.

Wave 4 - create an Archon Hallucination (C)(N) and then while the
Marines and Marauder are attacking it, use Psionic Storm on them, and
focus fire your Sentries on the Marauder.

Wave 5 - set up Force Fields at the top of the ramp to prevent the
Zerglings and Banelings from getting up and use Psionic Storm to take
them out.

Wave 6 - create 2 Archon hallucinations, set them up on either side of
the top of the ramp, use a Psionic Storm on the Marines and Marauders,
making sure to get all 3 Marauders in it, use your Sentries to focus
fire on the Marauders 1 at a time.

Wave 7 - get to the south ramp quickly, set up 3 Force Fields to
block the path as the Zerglings get to the ramp, let the Sentries
take them out.

Wave 8 - as the enemy Sentry units are moving along the edge, use a
Psionic Storm at the lead, so they walk through it.  As the Zealots
get to the ramp, block the top with Force Fields and use Psionic
Storm to take them out, this should also catch the Sentries.

Wave 9 - don't waste any time, create 4 Stalker hallucinations (C)(S),
you get 2 with each cast, send them to the north ramp.  While the
Reapers are moving for them, hit them with a Psionic Storm, target
them with your Sentries.

Wave 10 - again, be fast, create 4 more Stalker Hallucinations and send
them to the east side of the platform, not to the top of the ramp.
While the Reapers attack them, hit them with lighting and finish them
with your Sentries.

Wave 11 - create Force Fields to block the Ramp, do so in a curved
manner which will allow the Zerg units to get in a nice group, hit
them with a Psionic Storm.

Wave 12 - Create 2 Stalker hallucinations and send them to the north
ramp.  When they start getting attacked, hit them with your Sentries
and a Psionic Storm.

Wave 13 - at the north ramp, create Force Fields to block the ramp and
hit the Stalkers with a Psionic Storm.  Create an Archon hallucination
and have it take the damage while the Sentries finish off the Stalkers,
if you need to, create 2 extra Stalker hallucinations to go with the
Archon.

Wave 14 - create 2 Stalker hallucinations and set them up near the south
ramp.  When the Reapers jump up, hit them with a Psionic Storm.  Create
2 more Stalker hallucinations and send them after the Ghosts.  Kill them
with your Sentries.

Wave 15 - get to the north ramp with at least 4 Stalker hallucinations,
let the Mutalisks attack them, hit them with a lighting and attack
with your Sentries.

Wave 16 - create a couple archon hallucinations for the Vikings to
attack while your Sentries kill them.  Meanwhile, create some Force
Fields to block off the Marines and Marauders and hit them with
Psionic Storm, clean them up with the Sentries.

At this point I had 9 Sentries and 6 High Templars left.

Wave 17 - move to the west ramp, its blocked by rocks, use your
sentries and a Psionic Storm to kill the Zerglings.

Wave 18 - use a Psionic Storm to kill the Roaches and finish them off
with your Sentries.

Wave 19 - use your Sentries and a Psionic Storm to kill the Ultralisk.

Wave 20 - north ramp, block the ramp with Force Fields and use a
Psionic Storm to kill the Banelings.

Wave 21 - use Force Fields to block the path so the Tanks can't get
to the ramp, use your Sentries from above to kill them.

Wave 22 - north ramp, get Force Fields up to block the ramp and hit
the units with Psionic Storms, create hallucinations and fight with
your Sentries.

Wave 23 - west ramp, let them break through the rocks, create Force
Fields to form a prison and use Psionic Storm to kill the Zerg.

Wave 24 - south ramp, create a barrier below the ledge, use lighting
to kill the protoss units while the Sentries shoot them from above.

Wave 25 - west ramp, create barriers at the bottom of the ramp,
use Psionic Storm on the Hellions, create 2 Stalkers to absorb the
damage from the Banshee and use the Sentries to kill it.

Wave 26 - north ramp, create Force Fields to block the Banelings,
create Stalker Hallucinations and put them on your side of the Force
Fields so the Mutalisks attack them in the same zone the Banelings end
up in, so when you use Psionic Storm they all get hit, use your
Sentries to finish them off, starting with the Mutalisks.

Wave 27 - south ramp, create Force Fields to block the path and trap
the Immortals and Sentries, use Psionic Storm and target the Immortals
with your Sentries.

Wave 28 - north ramp, create Force Fields trapping the enemy units,
use Psionic Storm to kill them, finish them off with your Sentries.

You pretty much have to create Archons now, create 2, leaving at
least 1 High Templar left.

Wave 29 - west ramp, create a couple of hallucinations, have them
take the hits from the Battlecruiser while your Sentries and Archons
attack it.  Use Feedback (F) with a Templar.

Wave 30 - north ramp, the Colossus will likely come at you before
you are done with the Battlecruiser.  Use an Archon hallucination to
distract it, have another one as back up, once the Battlecruiser is
destroyed, finish off the Colossus.

Wave 31 - south ramp, create archon hallucinations and have them take
the damage 1 at a time, while you blast it from a safe distance.

Wave 32 - west ramp, use Feedback on the Thor, use Archon hallucinations
and your units to kill it.

Wave 33 - north ramp, mothership, use Feedback on it, use all the
Psionic Storm you can, then make Archons with what ever Templars you
have left.  Make as many Archon hallucinations as you can and use
everything you have.

My Kills: 300 (100%)





> XD06 - Zerg Infestation: Gold
===============================

This is all about Neural Parasite.  Memorize the location of the High
Templar on the west ramp, the 2 Siege Tanks on the highest level, the
Colossus to the north east, the 3 Siege Tanks on the middle level,
the Colossus on the 2nd ramp, you will send burrowed Infestors to these
units immediately.  Send 3 roaches to the north and south, there are
3 spread out Marines, send 2 roaches to each of the Siege Tanks on the
Highest level.

Start by using the 3 Roaches at the north and the south paths to kill
the Marines, while you unburrow your Infestors and Neural Parasite on
the Colossus in the north, the High Templar on the Ramp and the 2 Siege
Tanks on the Highest level.

Use the Colossus to kill the Marines on the highest level to the north
first, then the level below.  Use the Templar to Psionic Storm the
group of units to the far south, then behind the Supply Depots on the
Middle level.  The Siege Tanks should have devastated the middle level
by now, use your Roaches to kill them, and your Colossus and the
High Templar.

Now use Neural Parasite on the mid level units, the Siege Tanks and
Colossus.  Move your old Infestors in to the bottom level near the
Colossus, Siege Tank and High Templars.  Once the Mid level units
have done their job, kill any left alive with your Roaches, and then
move your Roaches in, let them take damage while you Neural Parasite
the bottom level units.

My Kills: 192





> XD07 - Harbinger of Death: Gold
==================================

This is the plan, group your Carriers and Phoenix units together,
they will attack to the north west, then move east.  Your High Templars
and Sentries will go south west, you will send your Stalkers to the
south east, you will send a warp Prism to the east and the rest
leave where they are.

Step 1.  Make your carriers clear out the Marines at the landing
zone to the East, set up your Warp Prisms to the north and send 1
to the east.  Blink your Stalkers up, send your Templars and Sentries
in.

Step 2.  Warp in 7 Dark Templar to the north east, use your Carriers
and Phoenix units to move north west, keep moving in with your Templars
Templars and Sentries, blink your south east Stalkers to the next
level.

Step 3.  Warp in Stalkers to the east Warp Prisms, move
east with your Carrier group, keep moving with your Templars and
Sentries, Blink your Stalkers in the south east again, keep moving
east with the second group of Stalkers.

My Kills: 216







> XD08 - Opening Gambit: Gold
=============================

This mission is on slow, and to me, that makes things worse.  I will
not say what is the right build order, as there is no such thing,
but you do have some goals, you need a bunker very fast to defend an
early Zergling rush, and you need Siege Tanks quickly as well.

You need to start building Ghosts and Siege Tanks as early as possible
and you need to keep building Marines from the start.  Don't spend
too much gas on non essentials as it will hinder your ability to make
the units you need.

So here is a general guide.

Send all your workers to minerals, train a new worker and set the
rally point on the mineral deposits that are not being worked.

Keep building SCV's, when you have 9/11 supply, build a Supply Depot.
Keep building SCV's, at 11/11 you need to build a Barracks.  Build
these where the ramp is, right on the ghost images.

At 13/19 build another Supply Depot on the ghost image, at 14/19, build
a Refinery.  Keep building Marines and SCV's at this point.  This is
where skill comes in, the ability to adapt as the game goes.

Get 6 SCV's on gas as fast as you can, never stop building Marines.

By 22 or 23 of 27 supply, you should be building a new Command Center
in your base.

Build a Factory next, get producing tanks.  Build another 2-4 Barracks
as minerals allow, get them all with the Tech Lab.

Get another Factory.  Expand and get gas first.  Use both Command
Centers to send SCV's to the expansion.

By 08:00 remaining, you should have 4 Siege Tanks, 2 Ghosts and 15
Marines.

By 06:00 you should have 7 Siege Tanks, 7 Ghosts and 20 Marines.

By 05:00 you should have all your Ghosts and Siege Tanks, and be
pumping out Marines.

My time: 04:31 remaining





> XD09 - Rush Defense: Gold
===========================

This one is really easy, first thing you do is build a Barracks,
put it just slightly below your base to the left.  Build 2 SCV's and
then keep building them.  The Barracks should have enough room to
build a Bunker between it and the Command Center, 3 spaces.

As soon as the Barracks is done, build a bunker and a Marine.  When
the Zerglings get there, attack with your SCV's, send them back to
the minerals when they get half their health gone, if you were fast
enough with the Barracks you will also have a Marine right away, have
Zerglings chase it until the Bunker is complete.

Once you survive the first attack, build a couple more Bunkers, keep
up the Marines and just play it out.

The next round is the same thing, except you need to kill the Protoss
Structures, just hold out till you have Marauders and Siege Tanks.

My units lost: 0





==================
SC2C - Custom Game
==================

Custom Games are played entirely unranked and include melee and custom,
custom being trigger based games that go far from the traditional way
of playing Starcraft.  Custom Games keep a record of games played, but
do not record wins in your League Wins count.

For the most part, these Achievements are based on you playing on your
own against computer opponents.  Though you do have to play some games
with computer players on your team as well.  Also, for the AI Romp
achievements, playing with evenly matched teams does result in
progress of the achievement.

Starcraft 2 is not a game where you can just always follow a guide, it
is a game that requires a level of skill to advance.  The sad reality
is that some achievements will simply be beyond your ability to
achieve.

TIP: You can play on harder difficulties to obtain credit for all
difficulties below the difficulty you played on.  In other words you
could play only against Insane A.I. opponents and gain credit for all
achievements at once.  This includes the race achievements in the
Medium A.I. section.

The best way to win this is just sit back in your base and build a
very strong army and while you're doing that, the other computers will
kill each other and you can just clean them up.





GA06 - Medium Blitz
===================

The best way to do this one is to play on a 2 player map, at the very
start send a Probe or SCV to the enemies base and build Gateways or
Barracks in their base and attack immediately.  with the Zerg save 200
minerals before building any drones and build a Spawning Pool, as soon
as its done build 3 Zerglings and send them to your enemies base,
keep sending Zerglings and you win.

As soon as the computer gives up, accept the surrender.

I don't like it, but the most effective means of accomplishing this
is always the Protoss cannon rush.  Same Strategy as above, but
you build cannons instead, works best against another Protoss.

find it.  Additionally the mini map has markers for where the
ingredients can be found.  Take note that some require you to kill
creatures, don't forget to pick the item up after you kill the creature.

Any extra ingredients in your inventory will not be used when you make
a recipe and will remain in your inventory after creating the recipe.

Don't forget to use any items you get as well as use (Q) Dash as often
as you can.  The abilities you get are to interfer with other players.

Each time you create a recipe twice in a row its value goes down by 50
points, creating a different recipe resets its value.

You can earn this achievement by yourself.

GF02 - Vitruoso
===============

Self explanitory, just build all the recipies you get at least once in
each round, key here is to know where the ingredients are.  And pick up
extra ingredients for the other recipies when you can.

See GF01 for more information.

You can earn this achievement by yourself.





======================
GF03 - Supreme Cuisine
======================

You will likely get this just by playing, but the best way to go for it
specifically is to create the recipies worth the most points.  Each time
you create the same recipe twice in a row, the value of the recipe goes
down by 50 points.  Creating a different recipe resets the points.

See GF01 for more information.

You can earn this achievement by yourself.





=====================
GF04 - The Heat is On
=====================

This is one you will need to be in a game with other players.

The great equalizer is a random item that you can get if you are not
in first place.  When the item is used it nukes who ever is in 1st.

So, to get the achievement you need to be in first place and someone
will have to randomly get the Great Equalizer and use it on you.  When
they do use it, you need to get near any other player and stay with
them until the nuke falls killing you and the other player.

This one is easy to get with a friend, one person gets into first by a
few hundred points and the other player just keeps turning in the first
recipe which gives the random items until they get it.  Then switch up.





=====================
GF05 - Allez Cuisine!
=====================

This is one of those achievements that you will likely get by accident
and is just a matter of luck and knowing the map.  The best way to go
for it specifically is to build the smallets recipe twice in a row
grabbing extra of the ingredients the first time around.

Also you can drop ingredients near the kitchen and go out and collect
a recipe, make it, grab the ingredients you dropped and make that
recipe.

See GF01 for more information.

You can earn this achievement by yourself.





===============
GF06 - Tag Team
===============

Playing against other players is often easier than against AI as skill
and knowledge of the game can vary heavily with players.  Find a good
friend and you will get this one easily enough.

======================
GF10 - Jewel Rock Star
======================

Beating a higher difficulty AI earns the achievements for lower
difficulty AI.

There is no work around to beating this.  You can't play with other
players or AI players.  Nor can you play on single player and abuse
saving and loading, you have to play on multiplayer 1 on 1.

Your only real chance of winning is within the first couple of minutes.
This requires a lot of luck and a lot of skill and speed.

Clearing gems by making rows of 3 or more gems gives you energy.  You
use your energy to train units and cast spells.  The tips here work on
the easier AI opponents - duh.

There is not a whole lot to say about the gem matching, just keep
playing it and you will get better.

Don't waste time trying to find lines, if you can't see any matches,
simply reset.  You always need to be clearing lines as fast as you
possibly can to have any chance of winning.

Knowing hot keys will help you build units without having to looking
away and stop matching gems.  The units and abilities have hot keys
in order as they appear on your keyboard.  Get used to using the
hot keys if you want to be a champion of this game.

All the units have strengths and weaknesses, specific uses, different
energy costs and strategies.  The key to success is with the units
and abilities you can use.

You can not control your units, but you will need to keep your camera
on the front battle line so you will know which units to train and to
use your powers.

As the computer builds random units and units to counter your units,
there is no one way to win, you will need to train the right units at
the right time, so learn them all below.

There is a decent trick you can do to win, get a fast 1000 energy,
reset the board and then build 4 Banshee's and as your building them
starting clearing gems and keep building Banshee's until you have 10
or more.  Start building Ghosts and don't stop until you get to the
enemy cannons and then build Banshee's again.

(Q) Zealot 50 energy - these units easy to acquire which is good
because they are strong against the massive Ultralisk and Immortal.
Use these units when ever you see an Ultralisk or Immortal coming your
way.  Additionally, if you wish to do an air attack, its a good idea
to have a couple Zealots incase your opponent has any Hydralisks.

(w) Hydralisk 100 energy - the primary purpose of these units is their
anti-air attack, build them if your opponent has air units, other wise
avoid building these units.

(E) Mutalisk 200 energy - these are one of the most useful offensive
units due to the fact they are strong against so many units.  Best used
when you build 4 or more and have some supporting units such as
Zealots or Roaches.

(R) Siege Tank 300 energy - only useful against buildings, especially
early in the game.  If you can get a couple of these out early you can
get rid of your opponents first 2 cannons pretty easily.  Otherwise
mixing one in with other planned attacks of units works as well.

(T) Colossus 500 energy - an over all strong unit good at clearing up
large groups of marines and an effective defensive unit.  Using it
offensively can be devestating if you have some air units supporting
it.

(A) Roach 75 energy - very cheap supporting unit, best used to support
air attacks.

(s) Ghost 100 energy - while weaker than the hydralisk, this anti-air
specialist is a much better supporting unit against air.  Better used
for offense than defense.

(D) Banshee 250 energy - has much better damage than the Mutalisk, but
only hits ground units.  Better as a defensive unit, but if supported
with some ghosts the combination can be devestating.

(F) Immortal 300 energy - much like the siege tank, getting a few of
these early can really cripple your opponents first line of cannons.
With its shorter range you are better off mixing this unit in with
your attacks than sending them on their own.

(G) Ultralisk 500 energy - overall the strongest unit in terms of
survivability, best used as first unit in with supporting units right
behind it.  An ultralisk with some Ghosts or Mutalisks is a very strong
attack.

(z) Reset Board - resets the board when you are out of moves
or can not see any moves.  This takes some time and eats up all your
energy, so be sure to build units before using it.  This is a last
resort ability.  Often better to reset board than try and find a
move if you've been playing the same board for a while.

(x) Warp Cell 150 energy - this is more of an offensive ability than a
defensive ability.  When attacking if your opponent builds a massive
unit such as a Colossus or Ultralisk, freeze it to gain a considerable
advantage.

(c) Time Bomb 200 energy - this is a defensive ability you will want
to use if your opponent has a large force coming your way, try and use
it so that it catches the back half of a group which will split their
forces making it easier to defend.

(v) Healing Wave 250 energy - one of the greatest keys to successful
attacks is using this ability on your expensive units to keep them
alive.  Do not worry about the additional healing, thats just a bonus
if there are any targets it can heal.

(B) Psionic Storm 300 energy - a brutal ability offensively or
defensively, as long as there is a large group of units to use it on
to maximize its effect.  Don't bother with it on single large units.
Also use it if there are some Siege Tanks hitting your cannons and
your units aren't getting to them quick enough.

So knowing the units and their best ussages, lets look at some of the
best combinations offensively.  We won't bother with defensive
strategies because combinations are not neccessary.

Now, there are 3 ways to go about attacking, the first is constantly
building units while you clear gems, the second is to save up a large
amount of energy and building a large force all at once then using
the energy you earn after that to send in support units, the third is
the same as the last strategy with the exception of using the energy
after the intial force to use abilities.





======================
GF11 - Jewel of Denial
======================

Basically you will need to use the (v) Healing Wave ability 8 or more
times to get this achievement.  One strategy is to build up full energy
and create an ultralisk, build up your energy while paying attention
to its health, when it drops down to orange health use the ability.
Keeping it alive for as long as you can while you keep on clearing gems
for more energy.

Another strategy is to not spend money on any expensive units and just
keep healing basic units.  This is a lot harder to do, but you will
get off more casts of the spell.  Expect to use it well over 10 times.

See GF10 for more information.





========================
GF12 - World of Orecraft
========================

This is yet another one you don't have a lot of control over as the
combos you will get are dependant on random gems that drop when you
make a line.

Your best bet at getting combos is by clearing 4 or 5 gems in a
single line with at least 3 gems crossing that line.  This offers the
most immediate gems and starts a combo itself.  The rest is just luck.

Playing closer to the bottom allows for a higher chance of combos.

See GF10 for more information.





=======================
GF13 - Live and Let Die
=======================

See GF17 for more information.





===================================
GF14 - Pleae Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em
===================================

Your best bet to get this is having a lot of Siege Tanks on high ground
and weaken the Stank with Marauders with Stim Packs before it gets to
your defensive line.

2 Stanks appear on night 4, the first is early and the 2nd is closer
to the end of the night and will still be around when day light comes
if you don't kill it first.





======================
GF15 - Die Another Day
======================

See GF17 for more information.





============================
GF16 - Here Comes the Hammer
============================

Basically if you can beat it on Brutal difficulty you should have no
problem getting this achievement.  You just have to be quick in getting
out and killing Infested structures.

At the very start send your starting troops to kill some structures,
set your rally points on your Vulture and build more Marines.  Just
keep building Marines.  You can pump out some Marauders later too if
you want.

As soon as you can during night 1, get medics and train a few extra.
Upgrade the Medics Healing and the Stim Pack technologies from the
Barracks addon.

Use what ever defensive line works best for you, but you will need to
go after Siege Tanks by night 4 to combat the Stank.

Each time you go out killing Infested Structures, stay out as long as
you can, like 5 seconds till night time.  Use Stim Pack a lot and
always be on the move.

Each day empty your Bunkers and use every unit you have available.
Though you can leave your Siege Tanks until the 5th day.

On the 5th day you will need to use everything even your Siege Tanks,
split your forces and go after what ever is left.

See GF17 for more information.





======================
GF17 - License to Kill
======================

Beating harder difficulties completes lower difficulty achievements
as well.  The strategies here will also work on lower difficulties.

It is highly recommended to do this with a partner, while possible to
do this on your own, its much harder.  I will write assuming you are on
your own.

Its important to note the special upgrades at the Science Facility,
which is the large red building in the middle of your 2 Command
Centers.  These upgrades use Biomass a special resource earned from
killing special Infested units and their Structures.

The units are all usefull if you use them right.  Siege Tanks, Medics
and Goliaths are by far the most useful.

The 4 upgrades are all very useful.  Some more than others depending
on how you play.

Special Infested Units:

Hunterlings are annoying, but easy to kill, they will jump into your
army and then quickly die.

Kaboomers are over sized Banelings that can do serious damage to your
forces and structures, best countered with Siege Tanks or Spider Mines.
They explode when killed.

Spotters are relatively harmless air units, just a few Turrets in
the right spots to take care of them.  They will freeze up your
structures so they can't defend, so don't forget Turrets.

Chokers are Infestor like units that will force a unit to it, again
Siege Tanks are your best bet for Survival, but use your forces to
target them as well.

Stanks are powerful Ultralisks that have lots of health and damage,
but are slow large targets, using Tanks, Spider Mines and hit and run
tactics will keep them down.

Starting - Day 1:

To start out you will want to get your workers gathering resources at
both bases, and then don't stop training SCV's until you have about 12
to 16 on each bases minerals and of course 3 on each of the 4 Vespene
Giesers.

Use your starting troops to go out and kill some Infested Structures,
from the lower right base go out and north and from your upper base
go straight west.  Avoid bunkers.

Your set up is ultimately up to you, and surviving the first night
is pretty much the hardest part, if it goes poorly, just restart.

Structural Defense:

Build bunkers on the high ground, as well as Missile Turrets, later you
can build Perdition Turrets as well.

The starting Bunker is too far out, you will want to build further in
your base allowing your troops on the high ground time to kill the
enemy before getting to your front lines.

Also you can use non combat structures to control the flow of enemy
units to your defensive structures.

Command Centers can be built and upgraded to a Planetary Fortress,
which are powerful defensive structures.

Don't forget to repair.

Unit Defense:

Siege Tanks and Goliaths make powerful defensive units, using medics
will also keep your non mechanical units alive, including SCV's when
repairing your structures and mechanical units.

A mix of units always works better than trying to use just one unit.

Regardless of your strategy, during day time use all your units to go
kill stuff.  You can keep them in one group, or divide your forces, its
up to you and your skill level.  Of course, when it gets to be night
you will want to be back in your defended position.

General Tips:

You should build 2 Armories and upgrade your land units from them and
the 2 provided Engenering Bays.  The faster you do this the better.
Also upgrade your units from Tech Labs.

What you decide to use your Biomass on is up to you, but getting
Hellions quickly can give you an edge.  After that Siege Tanks help
a lot.  Also Medics combined with Marines are very effective.

Don't forget to use Spider Mines and Stim Pak.

Build additional Barracks and Factories.

Use high ground.





==========================
GF18 - Night of the Living
==========================

See GF20 for more information.





============================
GF19 - Night of the Living 2
============================

See GF20 for more information.





============================
GF20 - Night of the Living 3
============================

You will want a good partner to make this easier, but it is possible
to do it on your own as well.

You will need to have an effective defense at both main entrances, use
a Planetary Fortress about where the starting Bunker is, then block
both sides of the Fortress using Bunkers.  Get a Bunker on all 4
accessable points of high ground.  When you can, get 2 Planetary
Fortresses at the top and one at the bottom, using Bunkers to finish
blocking the entrances off.

Keep building units until you get Siege Tanks and then load up on the
Siege Tanks at every Entrance, at least 6 per entrance.  Then just make
a massive mobile army of mixed units and bring that army to which
ever defense point needs defending.

Nydus Worms will spawn inside your base so you will need to have your
mobile army in the middle of your base ready to take it out when it
appears.

Stanks and Nydus Worms health increases by 1000 each time they appear.

Don't forget to leave a bunch of SCV's scatter around your base to
repair.

Every 5th wave you survive will give a bonus of Minerals and Gas.





=================
CMGE - Outmatched
=================

For this one every achievement is basically the same, so I will write
only the strategy for beating 4 Very Hard AI and for the 2 Insane AI.

> **** - Outmatched: 2 Medium AI
> **** - Outmatched: 3 Medium AI
> **** - Outmatched: 4 Medium AI
> **** - Outmatched: 2 Hard AI
> **** - Outmatched: 3 Hard AI
> **** - Outmatched: 4 Hard AI
> **** - Outmatched: 2 Very Hard AI
> **** - Outmatched: 3 Very Hard AI
> GE01 - Outmatched: 4 Very Hard AI
> GE02 - Outmatched: 2 Insane AI
> **** - Outmatched: Outmatched Crusher





=================================
GE01 - Outmatched: 4 Very Hard AI
=================================

Just a tip, you can complete all normal and hard outmatched achievements
by winning against very hard computer opponents for each outmatched
situation (2, 3 and 4).

I just want to make very clear, if you are even reading this, you are
likely not good enough to complete all the Outmatched challenges.
Doing this is incredibly difficult, requires luck and an immense
amount of skill.  It can also take a very long time as well, in a
game you win you may have played more than an hour.

Surviving any outmatched situation requires a very strong defense.  The
basic concept is let them send their units to their death while you
build up a strong enough offense to take on the enemy forces outside
your base.

Also hit and run tactics that cripple their economy will also slow them
down enough to give you an edge.  Get behind their base early with air
and kill their workers and their Nexus, Command Center or Hatchery.

When you do have a strong force, don't try and fight in open ground
where you can be overwhelmed, try and take out part of an enemy base,
then as the other forces arrive, evacuate and regroup for an attack on
another base.

The best time to attack is always after defending an attack.

The Terrans have the best defense, by using Siege Tanks and bunkers,
with blocked off choke points you can devastate your enemies ground
forces.  You can also use Vikings to take out enemy air units.

Zerg have a slightly harder time defending.  Use of Spine and Spore
Crawlers is not enough, you need units as well.  Having some burrowed
ground units outside your defense is a good way to hit from behind.
If you can hold out long enough to get to Guardians, you will be able
to hold out against ground units a lot better.  Infestors are also
useful as are roaches.  You need to be really good with the Zerg to
accomplish the more difficult outmatched achievements.

Protoss are in between the other 2 races for defense, their cannons
hit both air and ground and you can build Templars to use their
Psionic Storm to do considerable damage to groups of enemies.

If you have a race preference, use your race, if you find you can
not accomplish the more difficult outmatched achievements, try the
Terran.  If Terran is your preferred race and you still can't do it,
it simply may be beyond your abilities.

For many of the outmatched situations you can also play on maps with
combined bases, such as Megaton, and then do a Protoss cannon rush.
This strategy will not always work against very hard computers,
especially when facing 4 of them.  But it can work.





==============================
GE02 - Outmatched: 2 Insane AI
==============================

This is very difficult as Insane AI computers are a lot more human
like in the way they build and attack.  Also, they gain extra
resources, +2 minerals and +1 gas.

Your best bet is to make an early rush on one of them, killing their
base and workers, making it so they can not rebuild.  You will also
need to be ready to defend against the other AI player who will have
a lead on you.  But if you can survive its counter attack, and you
were successful in eliminating the first computer, you should be
able to pull it off.

Also, you can attempt to defend against both computers, but its not
all that easy.  They will find your weak spot and exploit it.  A strong
offense is always your best bet when facing insane computer opponents.

You can technically win using a cannon rush here as well.  Though it
requires micro.  You need more than 1 Probe and need to build cannons
and draw Probes away with your Probes.





=========================
Section 04 - Multi-player
=========================

This section will cover the multi-player achievements, offering tips on
how to quickly complete the specific event achievements.  The majority
of the multi-player achievements simply require wins and will not be
looked at in any level of detail.





==================
SC2D - Cooperative
==================

Cooperative games are played as 2vs2 or 3vs3, with one team of human
players, and the other team being computers.  The computers players
have a difficulty setting of easy, medium, hard, very hard and insane.

Starcraft 2 is not a game where you can just always follow a guide, it
is a game that requires a level of skill to advance.  The sad reality
is that some achievements will simply be beyond your ability to
achieve.

For the Race A.I. achievement, you will not get credit for wins against
more difficult opponents, this is contrary to most of the other
achievements.

TIP: You can play on harder difficulties to obtain credit for all
difficulties below the difficulty you played on.  In other words you
could play only against Insane A.I. opponents and gain credit for all
achievements at once.  The same goes for the race achievements.

==================
SC2E - Quick Match
==================

Quick Match games are games played against other players, this is the
foundation of Starcraft's success.  You can play solo in the 1vs1
league, or play in the team leagues in 2vs2, 3vs3 and 4vs4 leagues.
The FFA option has no league and as such will give you no credit to
your league wins record.

Starcraft 2 is not a game where you can just always follow a guide, it
is a game that requires a level of skill to advance.  The sad reality
is that some achievements will simply be beyond your ability to
achieve.

=============
SC2F - Combat
=============

Combat achievements are achievements you can earn playing in Custom,
Cooperative and Quick Match games.  All these achievements can be
earned in Quick Match games.  Though some can be earned in Custom or
Cooperative Games.

Custom Games offer the easiest means of earning achievements as you can
focus entirely on the achievement without having to worry about a human
player bitching at you.

Though Cooperative Games offer a fairly easy means of achieving some
achievements that would otherwise be hard to earn in League Games.  If
you have a friend who is willing to help work with you to earn
achievements things can go very well.

So the lowest level of difficulty is Custom, then Cooperative and the
hardest Quick Match.  Each achievement will tell you which game modes
you can complete the achievement in.

Any achievement that can be earned in Custom Games, can be earned
playing against a human player.  This means you an a friend can team
up and take turns accomplishing some achievements by playing against
or with each other.  The setting must remain on Melee though.  And as
not everyone has friends, I will write assuming you have none and how
to earn the achievements playing only with computers.  Though I added
a couple achievements that can be easily accomplished with friends,
that are hard, if not impossible to complete against computers or
in League games.

at your main base, and then expand to a rich mineral expansion early.

Build a small amount of cannon defense at your expansion, and then
expand to the next rich mineral expansion.  Just keep building cannons

Repair 1000 life on Allied structures in a single Melee Game.

You can place SCV's in any Terran Ally's base and hope they take
enough enemy damage for you to repair and earn the achievement, or you
can force the issue in a couple different ways.

Friendly fire from your units or an ally's will not count.

You can not get this one by repairing your own structures.

If you have 2 friends willing to help you out, you can create a custom
game, you and a friend as Terran, and your 3rd friend as any race on
the other team.

Send some of your SCV's to your team mates base and have the 3rd
friend send some offensive units to your ally's base and attack the
Command Center and you just repair it until you get the achievement
and then you all quit the game.

If you do not have any friends to play with, create a 2vs1 Custom
Game, you and a medium computer both as Terran, against any race
medium computer.

You will need to build yourself a solid defense so the enemy computer
attacks your computer ally.  Send a bunch of SCVs to your ally's base.

You will need to use your forces to kill your ally's forces and let
the enemy work over your ally's structures.  Kill the enemy forces
once some damage has been done.  Use your SCV's to repair the
structures.

Repeat as necessary.  Its not easy, but it can be done.  There is
some luck involved, just keep trying and you will eventually get it.

TB01 - I See Dead Units
=======================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 10 cloaked or burrowed units in a single Melee Game.

You will likely just get this achievement in a random game against
other players.

This achievement is almost impossible to earn intentionally on your
own.  Computer opponents rarely use cloaked units, and finding
burrowed units to kill is even harder.

Your best bet is to have a friend play as Zerg and you as Terran,
have your friend build up to being able to Burrow, and you build some
Marines and a Orbital Command (Command Center upgrade).

Send your Marines to your Zerg opponents base and wait until he has
Burrow.  Have him burrow 10 Drones, use your Scanner Sweep to reveal
the Drones and kill them.

Once you have the achievement, you can both quit.





TB02 - Psionic Death
====================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 20 units with a single High Templar in a Melee Game.

The easiest way to do this is play a 1vs1 Custom Game against a medium
computer, you Protoss, the computer Zerg.

Build Photon Cannons outside the computers expansion, trapping them in,
but leaving them room to expand.  Get a High Templar as fast as
possible and start Zapping right away.  Keep the computer trapped and
you will eventually get it.




 
TB03 - Meatgrinder
==================

Kill 50 supply worth of units in 15 seconds in a Melee Game.

This is one of those ones I wouldn't even bother going after
intentionally.  Just playing normal games you will end up getting it.

Using Siege Tank or Colossus units is your best bet.





TB04 - The Back Door
====================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Warp in 50 units with Warp Prisms in a single Melee Game.

This is pretty basic, though you do need to work at it.  Build a bunch
of Gateways, get a Cybernetics Core and upgrade the Warp Gate upgrade.
Build a Robotics Bay and train a Warp Prism.  Set up the Warp Prism
and start warping in units.

Done throughout a normal game you can achieve this fairly easily.

Though if you want, start a Custom Game, 1vs1 against a medium computer
player.  Cannon him in and build up the required stuff from above.

Now just sit back and warp in your units.  You can also use your own
cannons to kill your units if need be.

If you do this in a League game, you can make your way half way to
earning the Warp In Madness achievement (TC13).





TB05 - Zerglot
==============

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Playing as Zerg, warp in a Zealot in a Melee Game.

This is not to hard, just play as Zerg against a medium computer on a
small 1vs1 map.  Play normally, get to the computers base and
destroy all its Pylons and buildings.  Do not accept its surrender.
Do not Kill the Nexus or workers.

When you can, build 2 Infestors and send them to the computers base.

Use Neural Parasite on one of the workers and build a Nexus and a
Pylon, you will need 500 minerals for this.

The Neural Parasite wears off quickly, let it.

When the Nexus is warped in, use the 2nd Infestor to Neural Parasite
another worker and build a Gateway.

Once the Gateway is warped in, build a Zealot.

This is all done inside the Computers base.





TB06 - Distorted Reality
========================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Capture 50 enemy units in a single Vortex in a Melee Game.

This is one of those achievements that is easiest to get if you have a
friend willing to help.  If you do not have a friend, play on 3vs3
games as Protoss and build up to a Mothership, eventually you will get
lucky enough to run into a large enemy force that you can Vortex.

Assuming you do have a friend, have them play as any race, Zerg is the
easiest, and you as Protoss.  Once you have built up to a Mothership,
your friend should have at least 50 Zerglings.  You need a Fleet
Beacon to warp in a Mothership from the Nexus.

Use Vortex on your friends units and you will get the achievement.





TB07 - To the Shadows I Run
===========================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Use Blink to save a Stalker in a Melee Game.

Playing as Protoss against any medium computer, play normally and
build up to the point where you have the Blink ability researched
from the Twilight Council.  When you have it, send a force of
Stalkers to the computers base, put the group on hold just out of the
computers base.

Using just 1 Stalker, send it in and have it take a lot of damage,
you need to blink it away when it is in the red with no shields.





TB08 - Can't Touch This!
========================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Dodge a Raven Seeker Missile in a Melee Game.

This is virtually impossible to do without a friend.  It can happen
in a random game, but trying to get it done intentionally is very
unlikely.

Play as any race with a friend playing as Terran in a Custom Game.
Have them build up until they have a Raven and the Seeker Missile
upgrade.

Send a fast unit of yours, a worker will do just fine, to meet your
friends Raven.  Have them use a Seeker Missile on it, and just simply
run away from it until it explodes.

Just in case you screw it up, having your friend build a couple Ravens
will be faster than waiting for enough energy for a 2nd attempt.





TB09 - Fire Fighter
===================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Save 8 burning Terran structures in a Melee game.

Play as Terran on a small 2 player map against a Protoss medium
computer player, send an SCV immediately to the computers base.

Build SCVs while your SCV is en route, as soon as the SCV gets to the
enemies base build a Barracks.

Build a Supply Depot.

Train more SCVs.  Make normal economy growth (get gas and lots of
workers on minerals, build Supply Depots, etc).

When your Barracks is complete, build a Bunker near the enemy
structures.  Send at least 2 more SCVs to the enemies base.

Train 1 Marine, put it in the Bunker as soon as its built.

You can hide your SCV's in your Bunker if they get attacked.

Build more Bunkers further away from the original Bunkers and put some
Marines in them.

As the computer attacks that first Bunker, wait until it enters the
low end of the orange and catches fire, use all your SCVs to repair it.

Build up to a Starport and build some Medivacs.

It shouldn't take long to get the achievement.





TB10 - One-Finger Discount
==========================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Cancel construction of a structure that is being destroyed by an
opponent in a Melee Game.

You will most likely get this one without trying, but to get it quickly,
just play against a computer, send a worker to the computers base and
build something, as soon as they start attacking it, cancel it.





TB11 - Just an Illusion
=======================

You can earn this in Custom, Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Control 15 Hallucinations in a single Melee Game.

Play against a medium computer opponent, build 4 Sentries and upgrade
the Hallucination ability from a Cybernetics Core.  Once all 4 Sentries
have 100 energy, use all 4 to create Probe Hallucinations (C)(E).

TC01 - Yamato Master Blaster
============================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 20 units with Yamato blasts in a single League Game.

Its not to difficult to get this one, build up to having at least 10
Battlecruisers, research the Yamato Cannon ability.  Once you have
enough energy on all your Battlecruisers, send them to an enemy
base and use the Yamato Cannons from all your Battlecruisers on
workers.

To keep your Battlecruisers from attacking the workers, issue an
order to the group to move across the base while you're in vision of
the workers, then while they're moving, press (Y) and target the
workers 1 at a time, then occasionally hold shift and issue the
move command across the base again.

Do this twice and you will have the achievement.





TC02 - Professionals Have Standards
===================================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 20 units with Sniper Rounds in a single League Game.

Build about 10-15 Ghosts, upgrade the cloaking ability and then send
your Ghosts to an enemies base, an expansion works even better.

Snipe all the workers.  If there was not enough workers, move on to
another base, or come back later.





TC03 - Infested Terror
======================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 30 units with Infested Terrans in a single League Game.

Playing against medium computers create 10 or more Infestors, have
the Burrow ability researched.  Once you have 10 Infestors, burrow
them and move them to an enemies base.

While Burrowed, mass create Infested Terrans (T) by pressing (T) and
clicking simultaneously as fast as possible.

Once you have a bunch out, move to another base.

Just repeat until you get the achievement.





TC04 - Beep, Beep, Boom!
========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 6 units with a single Seeker Missile in a League Game.

Best way to do this is get a Raven or 2 and send them to the main
base of a Zerg opponent.  Target a Larva with the Seeker Missile and
you should get it.





TC05 - Would You Kindly...
==========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 5 units with a single Neural Parasited unit in a League Game.

This one can be done if you have a lot of patience.  Build up to having
about 8 Infestors, an army of Hyrdalisks and let a medium computer
game get to the point where they are using advanced units.  carriers,
Thors, Battlecruisers, Colossus work best.

You will need to be attacking the computers forces and use at least
2 Neural Parasites on the advanced units as early as possible, keeping
your Infestors protected by your Hydralisks.





TC06 - Unbreakable!
===================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Kill 40 units with a single unit in a League Game.

Your best bet is to bunker in with the Terran and have 1 Siege Tank
safely behind the bunkers.  Don't forget to have a few Missile Turrets
and a bunch of SCV's set to auto-repair.  Just let the computers
attack you and you will eventually get it.  If the computers aren't
attacking you, just try again in another game.

Also, a less direct and more of a chance system is just having hit and
run tactics with a small force of air units on workers.  After a lot
of attacks, one of your units will get the 40 kills.

You may also just get the achievement while playing normally, without
having to try and get it.





TC07 - Auto-Kill
================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Using Auto-Turrets, destroy 20 SCVs in a single League Game.

You can easily accomplish this in a 2vs2 against medium computers,
as long as at least one of them ends up as Terran.  Play slowly, get
a couple Ravens, make a frontal attack with your normal army and
while they are engaged use the Ravens to use Auto-Turrets around the
computers mineral deposits.

You will need to do this at least twice.





TC08 - Raining Blood
====================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy a fully loaded transport in a League Game.

Another one of the achievements that are very difficult to get
intentionally.  Your best bet is to just wait until you get it in a
random game as you have absolutely no control over enemies and what
they do.





TC09 - Nuclear Launch Detected
==============================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Kill 15 enemy units with a single Nuke in a League Game.

You can get this one by sending a few Ghosts into an enemy base, make
sure they are set to hold fire.  Nuke the enemies Command Center.
There should be enough workers to get the achievement, but the
computer may move its workers to safety.

You can also try and Nuke the enemy forces during an attack on your
base.

The way I did it was having 6 Battlecruisers attacking the computers
base and Nuked their attacking units while they were fighting the
Battlecruisers.  This was all in their resource area.





TC10 - Terran Macro Master
==========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Have 9 Terran units training simultaneously in a League Game.

Best way to do this is have 5 Barracks with the Reactor attachment.
When all 5 have it, build 10 Marines and you will get the achievement.





TC11 - Protoss Macro Master
===========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Have 9 Protoss units warping in simultaneously in a League Game.

The best way to do this is to simply build 9 Gateways, once all 9 are
warped in, save 900 minerals and build 9 Zealots.





TC12 - Zerg Macro Master

Have 21 Zerg units morphing simultaneously in a League Game.

21 Larva and 21 free supply, build 21 Zerglings.





TC13 - Warp In Madness
======================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Warp in 100 units with Warp Gates in a single Melee Game.

and you will eventually get the achievement.

Spawn Larva with your Queens and you will eventually get the
achievement.





TC15 - Neighborly Help
======================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Heal 300 life on friendly units in a single League Game.

Incredibly easy, as long as you have a few Medivacs flying around with
an ally's ground units in battle you will get it without having to
work at it.





TC16 - The Flying Heal Bus
==========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Heal 5000 life with Medivacs in a single League Game.

Make about 8 Medivacs and 24 Marines.  Have the Stimpack upgrade
researched and use the Stimpack ability until your Marines are all
in the red.  Let the Medivacs heal them completely and repeat.

You can do this safely in your base.  It can take a little while and
you may run out of energy on your Medivacs, but just hold out for a
bit and do it again.

Eventually you will get it.





TC17 - Frugal Fighter
=====================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Regenerate 500 shield energy on a single unit without taking friendly
fire in a League Game.

Pretty simple, play a 2vs2 Cooperative game, turtle in and build up
until you have a single Carrier.  Send the Carrier to one of the
computers bases, have it attack and let it get attacked until its
shields are gone.  Retreat to safety.  Allow all its shields to
regenerate and repeat.

Having upgraded shields and ship armor will help keep your Carrier
alive.





TC18 - A Roach's Life
=====================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Regenerate 500 life on a single Roach without taking friendly fire in
a League Game.

The easiest way to do this one is build a Roach, have the Tunneling
Claws upgrade so your Roach can move while burrowed.

Find an enemy base with a Photon Cannon.  Bring your Roach while
burrowed into range of the cannon and leave it there taking damage
until it nearly dies and run.  Bring it back and repeat until you
get the achievement.





TC19 - Shroom Absorption
========================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Absorb 1000 damage with hallucinations in a League Game.

Simply build at least 8 Sentries, upgrade the Hallucination ability
from a Cybernetics Core and wait until you have 100 energy on all the
Sentries.

Either push towards the computer, or wait for them to attack.  When
you're near the enemy forces, create 8 Colossus (C)(C).  Send the
hallucinations into the enemy forces and you should get the
achievement.





TC20 - Counter-Proof
====================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Attack for 20 seconds with no counterattacks in a League Game.

In all likely hood you will get this one just by playing.  If you want
to try and get it intentionally, you can build an air unit and have it
outside a computers base, once the computer is attacking you, attack
the computers base.  If the computer leaves its attack, you should end
up getting the achievement.





TC21 - Carnage Hall
===================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy 4 enemy bases in a single League Game.

You will likely get this one just by playing.  Your best bet is to
play 3vs3 medium computers.  You need to be aggressive as you won't
get credit if your allies kill the bases.





TC22 - Denied
=============

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Destroy an enemy base while its under construction in a League Game.

The easiest way to make sure you get this one is to play against
medium computers as Zerg.  Send a Zergling to every expansion and
burrow them.  When the computer expands, send your army to the
expansion and destroy it.





TC23 - Hot Pickup
=================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Load a Dropship with a unit that is under attack in a League Game.

First thing, I tried about at least 5 times as Protoss and couldn't
get this.  But on the first try it worked as Terran.  I never had the
chance to test this as Zerg as you can't earn the achievements twice.
If anyone tries and finds out if you can, let me know.

So to do this, you need a dropship and an army.  While fighting the
enemy, watch for a unit that is getting attacked and use your dropship
to pick up that unit.





TC24 - MULE X'ing
=================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Call down 30 MULEs in a League Game.

Its sort of hard to get this one without trying.  What I did was in a
game I build 5 Command Centers in my main base and just kept calling
down MULEs until I got it.





TC25 - Big Brother Is Watching
==============================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Hold a Xel'Naga Tower for 5 consecutive minutes in a League Game.

At the very start of a 2vs2 medium computer game, send a worker to a
Tower and leave it there, you will eventually get the achievement.





TC26 - Meet the Spy
===================

You can earn this in Cooperative and Quick Match games.

Kill 5 Changelings in a single League Game.

You won't be getting this one against medium or hard computers.  You
will likely only ever get it in a vs player game in which you will
have no control over whether or not they will use Changelings.

You will need detectors to see the Changelings.
